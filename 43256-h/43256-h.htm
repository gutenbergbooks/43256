<h1 title="">WITCHES COVE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />MYSTERIES OF THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>It was night on Casco Bay off the coast of
Maine. There was no moon. Stars were hidden
by a fine haze. The distant harbor lights
of Portland, eight of them, gleaming faintly
in pairs like yellow cat&rsquo;s eyes, served only to
intensify the blackness of the water and the
night.</p>
<p>Ruth Bracket&rsquo;s arms moved backward and
forward in rhythmic motion. She was rowing,
yet no sound came from her oarlocks. Oars
and oarlocks were padded. She liked it best
that way. Why? Mystery&mdash;that magic word
&ldquo;mystery.&rdquo; How she loved it!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>In the stern of the little punt sat slim, black-haired,
dark-eyed Betty Bronson, a city girl
from the heart of America who was enjoying
her first summer on the coast of Maine.</p>
<p>Betty, too, loved mystery. And into her life
and that of her stout seashore girl companion
had come a little mystery that day. At this
very moment, as Ruth rested on her muffled
oar, there came creeping across the silent waters
and through the black of night a second
bit of mystery.</p>
<p>The first mystery had come to them on
shore in the hold of a beached three-masted
schooner.</p>
<p>Ruth knew the schooner well enough. She
had been on board her a dozen times and
thought she knew all about her&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The owner, a dark-skinned foreigner who
had purchased the schooner six months before,
used her for bringing wood to the islands.
There is, so they say, an island in Casco Bay
for every day in the year. Each island has its
summer colony. These summer folks like an
open fire to sit by at night and this requires
wood. The schooner had been bringing it in
from somewhere&mdash;from Canada some said. No
one seemed to know for sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Being an old schooner the wood-carrying
craft must be beached from time to time to
have her seams calked. They beached her at
high tide. Low tide found her stranded. The
return of high tide carried her off again.</p>
<p>In this there is no mystery. The mystery
began when Ruth and Betty, along with other
girls and boys of the island, swarmed up a
rope ladder to the tilted deck of the beached
schooner.</p>
<p>Being of a bolder nature than the others,
having always a consuming desire to see the
hold of so ancient a ship, Ruth had led Betty
into the very heart of the schooner and had
opened a door to pursue her investigation
further when a harsh voice called down to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here now. Come out&rsquo;a da sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a foreign skipper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Startled, the girls had quickly closed the
door and bolted up the gangway. Not, however,
until they had seen a surprising thing.
They had seen three bolts of bright, red cloth
in that cabin back of the hold. Were there
others? They could not tell. The place had
been quite dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looked like silk,&rdquo; Betty had said a few
moments later as they walked down the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Ruth replied. &ldquo;Probably only
red calico, a present for the wood chopper&rsquo;s
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three bolts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three wood choppers&rsquo; wives with seven
children apiece,&rdquo; Ruth laughed.</p>
<p>She had found this hard to believe. There
certainly was something strange about those
bolts of cloth, and the foreign skipper&rsquo;s desire
to get them away from the cabin.</p>
<p>And now, as they listened in the night on
the bay with muffled oars at rest, they caught
the creak of oarlocks. The schooner had got
off the beach with the tide. She was anchored
back in the bay. That the dory had come from
her they did not doubt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they going?&rdquo; Betty asked in a
faint whisper as the sound of rowing grew
louder, then began to fade away in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;House Island, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only an abandoned house and the old fort.
No one living there. Strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really mysterious,&rdquo; Betty agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll row around the <i>Black Gull</i>, then we&rsquo;ll
go home,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>
<p>Visiting the <i>Black Gull</i>, an ancient six-master
that had lain at anchor in the harbor
months on end, was one of Ruth&rsquo;s chief
delights.</p>
<p>Steam and gasoline, together with the high
price of canvas, high wages and demand for
speed, had brought this slow going craft to
anchor for good.</p>
<p>So there she stood, black and brooding, her
masts reaching like bare arms toward heaven,
her keel moving with the tide yet ever chafing
at the massive anchor chain that was never
drawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Night was the time to visit her. Then, looming
out of the dark, she seemed to speak of
other days, of the glory of Maine&rsquo;s shipping,
of fresh cut lumber, of fish and of the boundless
sea.</p>
<p>It was then that Ruth could fancy herself
standing upon the deck, with wind singing in
the rigging and setting the sails snapping as
they boomed away over a white-capped sea.</p>
<p>They had rowed to the dark bulk that they
knew to be the <i>Black Gull</i> and had moved
silently along the larboard side, about the
stern and half way down the starboard side,
when of a sudden a low exclamation escaped
Ruth&rsquo;s lips. Something had brushed against
her in the dark.</p>
<p>The next instant a gurgling cry came from
the bow of the boat. This was followed by a
splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s overboard!&rdquo; thought Ruth, reversing
her strokes and back paddling with all
her might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo; came a call from the water. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
over here! Some-something pulled me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So astonished was the stout fisher girl that
for a moment she did not move. Something
had taken her companion overboard. What
could it have been?</p>
<p>By the time she had come to her senses,
Betty had gripped the gunwales of the boat
and was calling for help. The next moment,
drenched with salt water, but otherwise unharmed,
she sat shivering in her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some-something caught me under the chi-chin,&rdquo;
she chattered, &ldquo;and ov-over I wen-went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt it,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, deftly, she brought the punt about
and alongside. Then, with both hands she
groped in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rope ladder.
How queer! There&rsquo;s no one staying out
here. There never was a ladder before. It goes
up to the deck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;What a lark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are drenched. You&rsquo;ll catch your death
of cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;B-best thing to d-do,&rdquo; said Betty, beginning
to chatter again, &ldquo;to take off my clo-clothes
and wring them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Ruth, fumbling for the
painter. &ldquo;Guess it&rsquo;s safe enough. Just tie the
boat to the ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment of feeling about and struggling
with ropes, then up they went, like blue-jackets,
hand over hand. Another moment on deck
and Betty was doing a wild whirling dance in
the dark while her companion&rsquo;s strong hands
wrung out her clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo-oo, it&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; shivered the city girl as
she struggled to get back into her sodden and
wrinkled garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re here, we
might as well explore. There&rsquo;s a cabin forward&mdash;the
Captain&rsquo;s. We&rsquo;ll be out of the wind
if we get in there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>They were more than out of wind in that
cabin. They found a great round stove set up
there. With the aid of two matches Ruth examined
its flue, and with a third she lighted
the fire that was laid in it. The next moment
Betty and her clothes were drying before a
roaring fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of being in such a place at ten o&rsquo;clock
at night!&rdquo; Betty said with a delighted shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might not be so good,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;That
ladder wasn&rsquo;t left there accidentally. Someone&rsquo;s
been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; she added suddenly.
&ldquo;While you are drying out I&rsquo;ll play I&rsquo;m the
ship&rsquo;s watch, and pace the deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think anything,&rdquo; said Ruth as she
disappeared through the door. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t safe
to take too many chances, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth had not been on deck three minutes
before, lost to all sense of impending danger,
she walked the deck, captain of this great sailing
craft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Few girls are more generously endowed
with imagination than are the fisher-folk&rsquo;s
daughters of the coast of Maine. None are
more loyal to their state and their seaboard.</p>
<p>As this girl now paced the deck in the dark,
she saw herself in slicker and high boots with
a megaphone at her lips shouting commands to
nimble seamen who swarmed aloft. Sails fluttered
and snapped, chains rattled, rigging
creaked as they swept adown the boundless
sea.</p>
<p>But now the scene was changed. No longer
was she aboard a great shipping boat, but an
ancient man-o&rsquo;-war. An enemy&rsquo;s sloop threatened
her harbor. With bold daring she set the
prow of her ancient craft to seaward ready to
do battle with the approaching foe.</p>
<p>Once more, her craft, half fancied, half real,
is a cutter, chasing smugglers and pirates.</p>
<p>Pirates! How her blood raced at the
thought. There had been pirates in those half-forgotten
days, real, dark-faced pirates with
cutlasses in their teeth and pistols at their
belts. Not an island on the bay but has its
story of buried treasure. And as for smugglers&rsquo;
coves, there was one not a mile from
the girl&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Smugglers!&rdquo; she whispered the word.
Rumors had run rife in the bay these last
months. Dark craft, plying the waters, were
supposed to be smugglers&rsquo; boats. A bomb had
sunk a revenue cutter. &ldquo;Smugglers!&rdquo; the people
had whispered among themselves.</p>
<p>She thought now of the three bolts of red
cloth in the beached schooner&rsquo;s hold, and of
the dory that had passed them in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smugglers!&rdquo; she thought. Then, &ldquo;Probably
nothing to it. Only a wood hauler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her heart skipped a beat. She had
thought of the rope ladder. What a hiding
place for smuggled goods, this deserted six-master,
lying alone in the dark waters of the
bay!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What if it were used as a smuggler&rsquo;s store
room,&rdquo; she thought as her pulse gave a sudden
leap. There was a fire laid in the cabin. The
ladder was down. &ldquo;What if some of them are
on board at this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought of the slim city girl sitting
alone there in the dark. Turning, she started
toward the cabin when a sudden sound from
the water arrested her.</p>
<p>The next instant, a few hundred yards from
the ship, a light flared up. The sight that
struck her eye at that moment froze the blood
in her veins.</p>
<p>For a full half moment she stood stock still.
Then with a sudden effort she shook herself
into action to go tip-toeing down the deck and
thrust her head in at the cabin door and whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty! Betty! Quick! Get into your
clothes! There&rsquo;s something terrible going to
happen. Quick! We must get off the ship!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />SCULLING IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>The thing Ruth saw on the water was startling,
mysterious. Nothing quite like it had
ever come into her life before. She could not
believe her eyes. Yet she dared not doubt
them. A moment before she had dreamed of
pirates with pistols in their belts. Now out
there on the sea they were, or at least seemed
to be, in real life. There could be no denying
the existence of a boat on those black waters
of night; a long narrow boat propelled by six
pairs of sweeping oars swinging in perfect
rhythm. This much the flare of light had
shown her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>More, too; there was no use trying to deny
it. She had seen the men only too clearly.
Dressed in long, black coats, with red scarfs
about their necks and broad-brimmed hats on
their heads, with their white teeth gleaming,
they looked fierce enough.</p>
<p>Strangest of all, there were pistols of the
ancient sort and long knives in their belts.</p>
<p>What made her shudder was the sign of
skull and cross-bones on the black flag they
carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirates! What nonsense!&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Not been one off the Maine coast in a hundred
years.&rdquo; Pausing to listen, she caught
again the creak of oarlocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty! Betty!&rdquo; she whispered frantically.
&ldquo;Hurry! We&rsquo;ll be trapped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Betty! She certainly was having her
troubles. Frightened half out of her wits; expecting
at any moment to be arrested for trespassing,
or who knows what, she struggled
madly with her half dry and much wrinkled
garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault,&rdquo; she half sobbed. &ldquo;I insisted
on coming up here. Now we shall be
caught. I&mdash;I hope they don&rsquo;t hang us at the
yardarm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>This last, she knew, was nonsense; but in
the excitement she was growing a trifle hysterical.</p>
<p>At last, with shoes and stockings in her
hands, she emerged from the door.</p>
<p>Gripping her arm tight and whispering,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak! Not a sound!&rdquo; Ruth led her
rapidly to the end of the rope ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me. Drop in the boat. Sit perfectly
still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tremblingly, Betty obeyed. Presently they
were in the punt. The sound of rowing came
much more clearly now. They could even hear
the labored breathing of the oarsmen.</p>
<p>Thankful for the darkness, Ruth thrust an
oar into a socket at the back of the boat and
began wabbling it about in the water. She was
sculling, the most silent way to move a boat
through the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-we&rsquo;ll go round the bow,&rdquo; she thought,
as a sudden sound set her heart racing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they don&rsquo;t light another flare!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>With a prayer on her lips which was half
supplication for forgiveness and half petition
for safety, she threw all her superb strength
into the task before her.</p>
<p>Many times she had rowed around the <i>Black
Gull</i>. Never before had it seemed half so far.</p>
<p>Now they had covered half the distance,
now three-quarters. And now there came a
panic-inspiring gleam of light on the sea. It
lasted a second, then blinked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a match.&rdquo; Her heart gave a bound
of joy. &ldquo;But if they strike another, if they are
attempting to light a flare!&rdquo; She redoubled
her energy at the oar. Great beads of perspiration
stood out on her brow as they rounded
the stern of the ship.</p>
<p>Even then catastrophe threatened, for the
ship&rsquo;s anchor chain, touched by the punt, sent
out a rattling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; came a bass voice from
the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>An instant later the sea was all aglow with a
second flare. But luck was with them. They
had rounded the ship&rsquo;s hull and were out of
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they row around her, we are caught,&rdquo;
whispered Betty.</p>
<p>Ten seconds passed, twenty, thirty, forty, a
minute. Then came the sounds of a boat
bumping the ship and of men ascending the
rope ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not coming!&rdquo; Ruth breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just move back under the stern by
the rudder,&rdquo; she whispered a moment later.
&ldquo;Even if they look over the side they won&rsquo;t be
able to see us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who-who are they?&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s question carried
a thrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; Betty barely suppressed a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; she said the next moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;And they are going
to man the <i>Black Gull</i> and sail her away. The
wind is rising. There&rsquo;s plenty of sail. A sail
boat makes no noise. What&rsquo;s to hinder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could they want with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know; for exhibition, sea pageant,
moving pictures, or something. Captain Munson,
the owner, has been offered ten thousand
dollars for her. Moving picture company
wants her. She&rsquo;s the last six-master in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; she whispered, impressively, after
there had been time for thought, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to
do something. We can&rsquo;t let the <i>Black Gull</i> go
like this. The <i>Black Gull</i> doesn&rsquo;t belong just to
Captain Munson. She belongs to all us Maine
folks. That&rsquo;s why he won&rsquo;t sell her. She
stands for something, for a grand and glorious
past, the past of our coast and of the most
wonderful state in the Union.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all on board now. We&rsquo;ll scull around
and get their boat. We&rsquo;ll tow it ashore so they
can&rsquo;t escape, then spread the alarm. Even if
they get out to sea, the fast cutter will catch
them and bring them back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I h-hope,&rdquo; chattered Betty, half beside herself
with fear, &ldquo;that they don&rsquo;t catch us. I
wouldn&rsquo;t like to walk the plank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ruth. There was an air
of conviction in her tone. Alas for conviction.</p>
<p>Once more their punt, creeping forward in
the dark, rounded the ship&rsquo;s hull and came at
last to a point but a boat&rsquo;s length from a long,
dark bulk just ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their boat,&rdquo; thought Ruth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be away
in a moment.&rdquo; But they were not.</p>
<p>That they were taking grave chances, Ruth
knew right well. Her heart was in her throat
as she sent her punt gliding through the dark.
Only thoughts of her beloved Maine and the
ancient six-master that stood for so much that
was grand and glorious in the past could have
induced her to run the risk. Run the risk she
did. Trouble came sooner than she dreamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>She breathed a sigh of relief when the dim
light told her that there was no one in the long
boat that had brought the black-robed crew to
the ship.</p>
<p>Her relief was short lived. She had succeeded
in untying the painter of that other
boat and swinging it half about, when there
came a harsh jangling of chains. A rusty chain
dangling from the side of the ship had caught
in the stern of the long boat and, slipping free,
had gone thudding against the hull. Ten seconds
of suspense ended with a gruff:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; and the sudden flash of a
brilliant electric torch which brought the two
girls out in bold relief.</p>
<p>At once there followed exclamations of
astonishment as dark figures crowded the deck
above them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to steal our boat,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to walk the plank,&rdquo; came from another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up with &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said another, placing a foot
on the top rung of the ladder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Ruth sat there, red-faced, defiant. Betty was
beginning to cry softly, when a fourth person
spoke up suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay off it, boys! Can&rsquo;t you see they&rsquo;re just
girls? I don&rsquo;t know what they are about, but
I&rsquo;m bound to say it can&rsquo;t be anything wrong.
One of &rsquo;em is Tom Bracket&rsquo;s girl. I know her
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s heart gave a great leap of joy. She
had recognized her champion&rsquo;s voice. He was
Patrick O&rsquo;Connor, the skipper of a sea-going
tug, one of her father&rsquo;s good friends.</p>
<p>At once her head was in a whirl. What could
it all mean? Captain O&rsquo;Connor dressed as a
pirate and aiding in a night raid of the harbor?
The thing seemed impossible.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken short off by the
voice of the man on the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still in favor of havin&rsquo; &rsquo;em tell their
story. An&rsquo; mebby girls don&rsquo;t care for pie and
hot coffee an&rsquo; the like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave it to them,&rdquo; said Captain
O&rsquo;Connor. &ldquo;If they want to come up we&rsquo;ll be
glad to have them. If they don&rsquo;t, then they
have their punt. Let them go. What do you
say, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Ruth. There was a large
lump in her throat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go up.
&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t do to let them misunderstand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truth was, there were things she did not
understand and that she wanted dreadfully to
know about.</p>
<p>So, once more, hand over hand, they went
up the rope ladder and tumbled in upon the
deck.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the two girls found themselves
seated one on either side of Captain
O&rsquo;Connor before the massive mahogany table
in the cabin of the <i>Black Gull</i>.</p>
<p>The table was piled high with good things
to eat. A great copper kettle filled with doughnuts,
a basket of sandwiches, two hams roasted
whole, a steaming tank of coffee, and pies without
end, graced the board. A merry band of
pirates, surely. Most surprising of all was the
fact that the pirate at the head of the table,
blackest and fiercest of them all, was none
other than Captain Munson, owner of the
<i>Black Gull</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Captain Munson, and there was
a friendly smile on his formidable face, &ldquo;I am
sure you will enjoy the meal more fully if you
tell us first why you were about to take our
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest assured,&rdquo; he said, as he saw the crimson
flush on Ruth&rsquo;s cheek, &ldquo;you stand absolved.
You shall not walk the plank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />IN THE DUNGEON</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; She choked as
she looked into the many pairs of eyes around
the table in the <i>Black Gull&rsquo;s</i> cabin, and stammered,
&ldquo;We thought you were,&mdash;no, we didn&rsquo;t
think. We knew you were not real pirates, but
we thought you&mdash;were&mdash;were going to stea-steal
the <i>Black Gull</i>. And we&mdash;we thought we
could stop you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No laugh followed these stammered remarks.
Each man sat at attention as Captain
Munson asked in a kindly tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you wish to save the <i>Black
Gull</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she stands for something wonderful!&rdquo;
The girl&rsquo;s tones were ringing now. &ldquo;Because
she tells the story of Maine, our grand
and glorious state we all love so well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo;&mdash;the pirate chieftain&rsquo;s dark eyes
glistened&mdash;&ldquo;I propose three cheers for Ruth
and her dauntless companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did the walls of that cabin ring with
lustier shouts than when those men ended with,
&ldquo;Ra, Ra, Ra! Ruth, Ruth, Ruth! Betty! Betty!
Betty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for the feast!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Chief. &ldquo;Fourteen men on a dead man&rsquo;s chest.
Buckets of blood! There never was a pirate
crew but liked their victuals. Ho! You scullions,
hove to with the viands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this talk made Betty shudder, but Ruth
only sat and stared.</p>
<p>They were hungry enough after the long
row across the bay and without asking further
questions they accepted the cold chicken, coffee,
doughnuts and huge wedges of pie and did
full justice to all.</p>
<p>A half hour later, as the pirate crew joined
ringing notes of a pirate chanty ending with
a rousing, &ldquo;Heave ho, Ladies, Heave ho!&rdquo; the
girls pushed their punt away from the towering
hull of the <i>Black Gull</i> and went rowing
away into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s arms had swung in rhythmic motion
for a full ten minutes before she spoke. Then
dropping her oars, she said in a deep, low tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the things I ever heard of, that beats
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Betty, solemnly, &ldquo;that I
had seen strange things, but that beats them
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And somehow,&rdquo; Ruth said, still more soberly,
&ldquo;I have a feeling that this is the beginning
of something very big and mysterious,
and perhaps awfully dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the way I feel about it,&rdquo; said
Betty, with a shudder.</p>
<p>After that they lapsed into silence, and Ruth
renewed her silent rowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The hour was late. Betty&rsquo;s head began to
nod. Ruth, alone with her thoughts, was
swinging her oars in strong, sweeping strokes
when a curious thing struck her eye. They
were passing the ancient abandoned fort on
House Island, a massive pile of solid granite,
when through a narrow space where cannon
had frowned in the long ago, a light appeared.
One instant it shone there clear and bright, the
next it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;No one is
ever there.&rdquo; At once she registered a resolve
to visit the fort to have a look into this new
mystery.</p>
<p>Once more she thought of the ancient wood-carrying
schooner, of the bolts of silk cloth in
her hold, and of the dory that had passed them
in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s astonishing,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;the way
events connect themselves up, woven together
in a pattern like a rug. But you have to trace
them out one by one before the pattern comes
out clear and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon was out. The stars were shining
when their punt touched the sandy beach of
the island that had always been Ruth&rsquo;s home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>A half hour later that same moon, looking
down upon a brown and weather-beaten fisherman&rsquo;s
cottage, beamed through narrow panes
of glass upon two girls sleeping side by side.
One was large and strong and ruddy. Her
arms, thrown clear of the covers, showed the
muscular lines of an athlete. Endless miles of
rowing, clam digging in the early morning,
hauling away at the float line of lobster traps,
had done this. There was about the girl&rsquo;s
whole make-up a suggestion of perfect physical
well-being which is found oftener than anywhere
else in a seacoast village.</p>
<p>The other girl, as you will know, was slim,
active and with nerves tight as fiddle strings.
Her life had been lived in the city. A few
months before she had gone with her father
to live at a school by the side of Lake Michigan.
Now, for the summer, she was staying
with a wealthy young married woman in her
summer cottage on the island. She was with
Ruth for but this one night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>As one looked at Betty lying there in repose,
he read in her face and figure signs of strength.
The slender arms and limbs were not without
their suggestion of power. Her strength was
the quick, nervous strength of a squirrel; useful
enough for all that. One might be sure
that she would leap into action while others
searched their troubled minds for a way out.</p>
<p>Strangely matched as they might be, these
girls were destined to spend much of their summer
together and to come to know in a few
brief weeks how much of mystery, adventure
and romance the rugged coast of Maine has to
offer those who come there to seek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; said Ruth as she sprang out of bed
next morning, &ldquo;do you know what day this
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t need two guesses if I didn&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Listen to the boom of
cannons. It&rsquo;s the Glorious Fourth of July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;we must do something
exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s tone was eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Ruth, seized with a sudden
inspiration, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spend them all for Roman candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roman can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth held up a hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get Pearl
Bracket to go along. We&rsquo;ll row over to House
Island in the evening and eat a picnic lunch on
the grass before the fort that overlooks the
bay. The sunset is wonderful from there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when it&rsquo;s getting dark, we&rsquo;ll go into
the old fort and have a sham battle with
Roman candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sham battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! The boys did that last year, Don and
Dewey, Chet and Dill and some others. They
said it was no end of fun. They&rsquo;re all going up
the bay for fireworks this year, so we&rsquo;ll have
the fort all to ourselves. We&rsquo;ll get Pearl
Bracket to go along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something of an adventure, just going
into that old fort at night. Secret passages and
dungeons with rusty old handcuffs chained to
the wall, and all that. Quite a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so. Is it very old?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fort? Almost a hundred years, I guess.
Used to be cannons there. They&rsquo;re gone now.
No one&rsquo;s been there for years and years. Just
big and empty and sort of lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you play sham battle in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All scatter out with tallow candles in tin
cans, just a little light. Each one has an armful
of Roman candles. When you hear something
move you know it is an enemy who has
broken into the fort, and you shoot a candle
at him, shoot low at his feet. Be dangerous if
you didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think what fun!&rdquo; she enthused.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re creeping along between stone walls,
all damp and old. Just a little light. Dark all
around. All of a sudden down the long passage
a little stir, and like a flash your fuse sputters.
Bang-pop-pop-pop-bang! Red, blue, green,
yellow, orange, five balls of fire leap away at
the enemy and he is shot, defeated, routed into
wild retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he might be,&rdquo; said Betty.
&ldquo;But it should be great sport. I&rsquo;m for it.
Any jolly thing on the Fourth of July.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />THE FACE IN THE FIRE</h2>
<p>Ruth let out a little half-suppressed scream.
A pasteboard tube slipped from her grasp and
fell to the floor. A purple ball of fire bursting
forth from the tube shot across the floor,
climbed a stone wall, then suddenly blinked
out. The yellow gleam of a tallow candle shot
downward. A tin can struck the floor with a
dull thud. The candle blinked out. Then all
about the girl&rsquo;s trembling figure was darkness,
darkness so complete that it seemed you might
cut it with a knife.</p>
<p>It was terrifying, that darkness, in an underground
place at night. Yet it was not the
darkness that affected her most. Nor was it
the ball of fire that had danced about her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>There had been another ball of fire, and
through that red ball of fire she had seen a
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The eyes! I
must have blinded him. How perfectly terrible!
Whatever am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed? She could not turn and run.
Which way should she run? The candle was
out. She had counted on the candle to show
her the way. The way she had taken was winding,
many turns, many corners, and always
stone walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she thought with a sinking feeling
at the pit of her stomach. &ldquo;Oh! Why did
I come?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started out to stage a sham battle.
And I have blinded a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man! Her thoughts were sobering now.
Questions arose. What was the man doing
here in the heart of the old abandoned fort on
House Island? That <i>was</i> a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His face was low down, close to the stone
floor, as if he were crawling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat. &ldquo;Perhaps he was
crawling. Perhaps I did not injure him after
all. He may be at my very feet now. Crawling!&rdquo;
The thought drove her overwrought
nerves into tremors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matches!&rdquo; she thought suddenly. There
was a penny box of them in her pocket. Until
now, in her excitement, she had forgotten
them.</p>
<p>The box out, she broke three matches trying
to light one. When the fourth flared up,
it so startled her that she dropped it.</p>
<p>In time, however, the candle was lit. Then,
with bulging eyes she stared before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she told herself in surprise.</p>
<p>She took three steps forward. Still nothing.
She advanced ten yards. Nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been here,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;But there is nothing and no one.&rdquo; She began
to shudder again. Had the Roman candle she
had fired into the dark revealed a lurking
ghost? Surely this ancient fort was spooky
enough. But no! Ghosts were nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; she told herself stoutly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man was here,&rdquo; she assured herself. &ldquo;I
saw him. I could not have been mistaken. He
is here for no good purpose&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be. I
couldn&rsquo;t have blinded him, else he could not
have found his way to&mdash;to wherever he has
gone. He&rsquo;s using this fort without permission&mdash;perhaps
for illegal purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No longer able to control herself, she went
racing on tip-toe down the narrow winding
corridor.</p>
<p>There came a sudden burst of moonlight,
and she found herself standing in a stone archway,
looking out upon a sort of open court
grown wild with tall grass, brambles and rose
bushes.</p>
<p>Old Fort Skammel, built before the Civil
War, has been abandoned for years to the rats
and bats that have found a home there. Yet
there is something suggestive of grandeur and
protecting power hovering over it still.</p>
<p>Ruth had felt this as she sat with Betty and
Pearl at the foot of its massive masonry and
ate her Fourth of July evening lunch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Following out her plan of the morning, they
had rowed over here, she and Betty Bronson
and Pearl Bracket, for a little picnic. Having
been brought up on the island across the bay,
the abandoned fort did not inspire in Ruth the
awesome fear that it did in some others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats in there,&rdquo; Ruth had said, munching
at a bun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big as cats,&rdquo; said Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid of fire, though,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
hurt you if you have a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; said Ruth, changing the subject as
she watched the red glow of the sunset, &ldquo;I
never see a sunset but I feel like I&rsquo;d like to get
on a ship and go and go until I come to where
that red begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;I sometimes feel that
way myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve traveled a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve lived on the banks of the Chicago
River and traveled on the Great Lakes.
And now you&rsquo;re here. That&rsquo;s a great deal. I&mdash;why
I&rsquo;ve only been on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea is wonderful,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
little world all its own. When you come to it
you feel that you have found something that
no one you know has ever seen before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;but of course
I&rsquo;ve always known the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And been everywhere on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only a little way. Why,&rdquo; Ruth said,
sitting up, &ldquo;right over yonder, not a hundred
miles from here, is one of the most interesting
islands in the world. Monhegan they call it.
I&rsquo;ve never seen it. But I shall some day, I
am sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sixteen miles from shore, a great rock
protruding out of the sea. If there wasn&rsquo;t a
smaller rock standing right in front of it and
making sort of a harbor, no one could ever
land there, for most of its headline is bold, a
hundred, two hundred feet high. These rocks
have strange names. Burnt Head, White
Head, Black Head and Skull Rock, that&rsquo;s the
names they&rsquo;ve given them. They say you can
catch beefsteak cod right off the rocks. It&rsquo;s
got a history, too. Captain John Smith was
there once and Governor Bradford. I want to
go there and watch the breakers come tumbling
in. It&rsquo;s wild, fascinating, you&rsquo;ve no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be lonesome,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonesome? Well, perhaps,&rdquo; Ruth said
musingly. &ldquo;Yes, I guess so. The sea always
makes me feel small and lonesome. Out there
almost everything is ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all they said of Monhegan. Little
they dreamed of the part that bewitching island
would play in their lives during the weeks that
were to follow.</p>
<p>Pearl had been timid about taking part in the
sham battle. At last the others talked her over.
So, armed each with a bundle of Roman
candles and a tallow candle stuck in a tin can,
they had made their way silently down the
long corridor that led to the gun room, from
which massive cannons had once looked down
upon the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky in here at night,&rdquo; Pearl had said
with a shudder. The sound of her voice
awakened dead echoes and live bats.</p>
<p>Betty felt like turning back, but Ruth plodded
on. Down a long, steep stairway, across
a circular court, then into a narrow passage
they went, until Ruth with a sudden pause
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! I hear &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, holding out her burning
candle. &ldquo;Get a light from this and shoot
straight ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With trembling fingers Ruth lighted a Roman
candle, watched the fuse sputter for a
second, then jumped as pop-pop-pop, three
balls of fire went shooting down between stone
walls to send an astonishing number of rats
scurrying for shelter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>It would be difficult indeed to find a more
exciting game than the one that followed.
And such a setting! An ancient and abandoned
fort. Down these narrow passageways
and resounding corridors had sounded the
tramp-tramp-tramp of marching soldiers.
Through long night watches in time of peace,
in stress of war, weary night guards had patrolled
their solemn beats. From these narrow
windows eyes had scanned the bay, while
like giant watch dogs, grim cannons loomed at
the gunner&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>In this small room, where chains, lifted and
dropped, give out a lugubrious sound, some
prisoner has sat in solitary confinement to
meditate upon his act of desertion or of treachery
against the land that offered him food and
shelter.</p>
<p>The three girls thought little of these things
as they parted to go each her own way down
separate corridors to meet sooner or later
with screams of terror and laughter as one
stealing a march upon another set balls of
fire dancing about her feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>A move in the dark or the slightest sound
called forth a volley of red, blue, green and
yellow fire. More often than not it was a rat
or a bat that drew the fire, but there is quite
as much sport in sending a huge rat scurrying
for cover as in surprising a friendly enemy.</p>
<p>So the battle had gone merrily on until Ruth,
finding herself alone in a remote corner of the
fort and, hearing a sound, had fired a volley
with the result we have already seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, here I am all alone,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Wonder where the others are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in there alone with that strange
man,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;How&mdash;how terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she could do nothing about it she knew
well enough, and was troubled about their
safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything serious should happen to them
I never could forgive myself!&rdquo; she thought
with a little tightening at the throat. &ldquo;They
are such good pals. And it was I who proposed
that we go on that wild chase, I who
really insisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was beginning to feel very uncomfortable
indeed about the whole affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>She and Pearl had been pals for a long time.
In the same Sunday School class and the same
grade at school, they were always together.
At the beach, swimming, boating and fishing
in summer, tramping and skating in winter,
they shared their joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;where is she?
And where is Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relighting her candle, she turned about to
go inside and search for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Place is a perfect
labyrinth, passages running up and down,
this way and that. Never would find them.
Have to wait. Have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. Had she caught some
sound? Were they coming? Or, was it some
other person, the man of the face in the fire?
She shrank back against the wall, then called
softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls! Betty! Pearl! Are you there?&rdquo;
There came no answer. &ldquo;Have to wait,&rdquo;
she told herself.</p>
<p>She fell to wondering about that mysterious
face, and what in time she should do about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>She and Pearl were fortunate in having as
a day teacher a splendid patriotic woman.
That very day they had come upon her sitting
on the grassy bank of their island that overlooks
Portland harbor. They had dropped to
places beside her, and together for a time they
had listened to the <i>bang-bang</i> of fireworks and
the <i>boom-boom</i> of cannons, had watched flags
on ships and forts and towers flapping in the
breeze. Then Pearl, who was at times very
thoughtful, had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me feel all thrilly inside and somehow
I think we should be able to do something
for our country, something as brave and useful
as Betsy Ross, Martha Washington and Barbara
Fletcher did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can,&rdquo; the teacher had said quietly.
&ldquo;You can honor these by helping to make this
the finest land in the world in which to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more you can do, wherever there
is an old fort, a soldiers&rsquo; home, or a monument
dedicated to our hallowed dead, you can help
prevent their being defaced or defiled or used
for any purpose that would bring a reproach
upon the memory of those who lived and died
that we might be free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; Ruth said to herself, &ldquo;what
sort of den I came upon just now in this grand
old fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, very quietly, very solemnly, she made
the resolve that, come what might, the whole
affair should be gone into, the mystery solved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they would come!&rdquo; she whispered
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth! Ruth! Is that you?&rdquo; sounded out
in a shrill whisper from the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shsh! Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; she warned as Pearl began
to babble excitedly. &ldquo;We must get out
of here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Wha&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later a punt with three dark
forms in it crept away from the shadowy
shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>They rowed across the bay in awed silence.
Having reached the shore of their own island,
they breathed with greater freedom; but even
here, as they climbed the steep board stairway
that led from the beach to the street above,
they found themselves casting apprehensive
backward glances.</p>
<p>Once in the main street of their straggling
village, with house lights blinking at them
from here and there, they paused for a moment
to whisper together, then to talk in low tones
of the probable outcome of their recent mysterious
adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully expected to see the <i>Black Gull</i> gone
when I looked out of the window this morning,&rdquo;
said Ruth. &ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still chafing at her chains. Poor old <i>Black
Gull</i>!&rdquo; Pearl always felt this way about the
discarded ship of other days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t expect the owner of the boat to steal
it himself. And he was a member of that terrifying
band.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the old wood-hauling boat and the
silks in her hold, (they were all sure the bolts
of cloth were silk by this time) and the dory
from her that passed us in the night,&rdquo; said
Betty. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the face I saw in the fire,&rdquo; said Ruth
with a shudder. &ldquo;Such a strange face it was,
dark and hairy and eyes that gleamed sort of
red and black. Oh! I tell you it was terrible! I
am glad we&rsquo;re all here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t go back,&rdquo; said Pearl.
&ldquo;Not for worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ruth said slowly, &ldquo;I think I would,
but in the daytime. Daytime would be different.
And someone should go. If that grand
old fort is being used by rascals they should
be found out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s been <i>so</i> many whispers about
smugglers this summer,&rdquo; said Pearl. &ldquo;Smuggling
in goods and men, they say. All sorts
of men that shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to come to
America at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Pearl excitedly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what he was! One of them, one of the men
America don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man, the face in the fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;not until we go back there.
Then perhaps we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted a moment later, Ruth to go
to her cottage on the slope, Pearl to her home
on the water front, and Betty to the big summer
cottage that tops the hill.</p>
<p>As Ruth lay in her bed by the window, looking
out over the bay that night, she felt that
the cozy and comfortable little world she knew,
the bay, the cluster of little islands, the all
enclosing sea, had suddenly become greatly
agitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if a great storm had come sweeping
down upon us,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery, thrills, adventure,&rdquo; she said a
moment later. &ldquo;I have always longed for
these, but now they have begun to come I&mdash;I
somehow feel that I should like to put out
my two hands and push them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />THREE GRAY WITCHES</h2>
<p>The next afternoon Pearl Bracket went fishing.
She felt the need of an opportunity for
quiet thought. The events of the past few days
had stirred her to the very depths. A quiet,
dreamy girl, she was given to sitting across
the prow of her brother&rsquo;s fishing boat or the
stern of her ancient dory as it drifted on a
placid bay. But this day only Witches Cove
would do.</p>
<p>To this imaginative girl Witches Cove had
ever been a haunting place of many mysteries.
A deep dark pool on three sides by the darkest
of firs and hemlocks, on the north of the
island where no sunbeams ever fell, it had always
cast a spell of enchantment about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>There, when the tide was coming in, water
rushed over half submerged rocks to go booming
against the granite wall, then to return
murmuring and whispering of many things.</p>
<p>Pearl sat in the stern of her dory on this
particular afternoon and recalled all the
strange tales that had been woven about the
cove.</p>
<p>At one time, so the story ran, it had been
a smugglers&rsquo; cove. Here in the days of
long ago, dark gray, low lying crafts came to
anchor at dead of night to bring ashore cargoes
of rich silks, tea, coffee and spices.</p>
<p>Still farther back it had been a pirates&rsquo; retreat.
Even the renowned Captain Kidd had
been associated with the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a very still day,&rdquo; Uncle Jermy Trott had
told her once in deepest secrecy, &ldquo;you can still
see a spar lyin&rsquo; amongst the rocks. That spar
came from a Spanish Gallion. I&rsquo;ve seen it. I
know. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve always held that a treasure
chest were lashed to it an&rsquo; that it were left
there as a markin&rsquo; thing, like skulls and cross-bones
were on land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Pearl had never seen the spar. But more
than once her fish-hook had snagged on something
down there that was soft like wood and
she had lost the hook and part of her line.</p>
<p>To-day, however, she thought little of the
spar at the bottom of the cove. She thought
instead of the strange doings aboard the <i>Black
Gull</i> and of Ruth&rsquo;s face in the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the old fort,&rdquo; she told
herself stoutly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more to that than
we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still,&rdquo; she thought, as she dragged a
larger cunner from the water, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Ruth&rsquo;s
discovery. It&rsquo;s only fair to let her go to the
bottom of it. Nothing important ever happens
to me. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to look at the cunner she had
caught. Its coloring was curious, all red, blue,
green and purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like he&rsquo;d been dipped in burning sulphur,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;Nothing in Witches Cove
is the same as anywhere else. They say it&rsquo;s
the three gray witches. Tom McTag saw &rsquo;em
once, three gray witches coming up out of the
water behind the fog. Boo! It&rsquo;s spooky here
even in daytime. Seems like eyes were peering
at you. Seems&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Her glance strayed to the bank. Then she
did receive a shock. Eyes were staring at her,
two pairs of glaring red eyes.</p>
<p>For a full moment she sat there petrified.
Then, as her senses returned to her, she made
out the figures of two huge black cats half
hidden in the green shrubs that capped the
rocky wall of Witches Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not real,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
witches&rsquo; cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To prove this, she caught up the blue, green,
purple cunner and sent it flying toward the
cats.</p>
<p>That settled it. Growling, snarling, sending
fur flying, they were upon the fish and at
one another, tooth and nail in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you greedy things!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Stop that! Here&rsquo;s another and yet another!&rdquo;
Two cunners followed the first.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>It was just as the cats settled down to their
feast that her ear caught a movement farther
up the bank and a quick look showed her a
very small man, wearing great horn rimmed
glasses. Squatting there on the steep bank, he
was staring at her, then at the cats. For a moment
he remained there. The next he turned
and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone living in the old Hornaby Place,&rdquo;
she told herself with a quick intake of breath.
&ldquo;Must be. Cats wouldn&rsquo;t be here. Nobody&rsquo;s
been there for more than six years, and it&rsquo;s the
only place on the island. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered many things before she was
through. And in the meantime she caught
some fish; not the sort she had hoped to catch,
however. Pearl, as has been said, was a
dreamer. One often dreams of bigger and better
things. It was so with her fishing.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, she caught her breath
and set her teeth hard as she tugged at the
stout codfish line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big one,&rdquo; she told herself as the
look of determination on her round freckled
face deepened. &ldquo;A big cod, or maybe a chicken
halibut. If only I can land him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two fathoms of line shot through her
fingers, cutting them till they bled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t hold him&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; she told
herself as, wrapping the line about her hands,
she braced herself against the gunwale, tipping
her dory to a rakish angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll land him,&rdquo; she avowed through tight
set teeth. &ldquo;Don won&rsquo;t laugh at me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many another girl born and bred on the
rugged coast of Maine, Pearl was fond of hand-line
fishing. Time and again she had begged
her big brother, Don, to take her deep-sea fishing
in his sloop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, little girl,&rdquo; he would laugh, &ldquo;look at
you! You&rsquo;re no bigger than a fair-sized beefsteak
cod yourself. If you got one on a line
he&rsquo;d pull you overboard. Then we&rsquo;d have an
awful time telling which was you and which
the fish, one or t&rsquo;other. You just stay and
wash your dishes, sister. We&rsquo;ll catch the fish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Pearl did wash her dishes. She did a great
many other things besides. But when the work
was done and the tide was right, she would dig
a pail of clams for bait and go rowing away to
the Witches Cove.</p>
<p>Usually she returned with a string of cunners
and shiny polloks.</p>
<p>That there were some wary old rock cod
hiding away in the secret watery recesses at
the bottom of Witches Cove she had always
known. That a halibut weighing fifty pounds
had once been caught there she knew also.</p>
<p>So to-night, with hopes high and nerves all
a-tingle, she tugged at the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tire him out,&rdquo; she told herself grimly. She
threw her shoulders back and gave a tremendous
tug. Without warning the line went
dead slack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost him,&rdquo; she all but sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no.&rdquo; As she reeled rapidly in, there
came another tug. Not so strong now. She
had no difficulty pulling the catch toward her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tangled round some kelp before,&rdquo; she told
herself disappointedly. &ldquo;Only a small one
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she was partly wrong, she knew in a
moment. A broad spot of white appeared in
the dark waters beneath her, and a moment
later she was landing a halibut weighing perhaps
twenty-five pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you beauty!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Now
they can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not a fisherman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two kinds of fish most relished by the
coast of Maine people are sword fish and young
halibut. Pearl&rsquo;s mother would be delighted.
Don and some of the other boys were off on
a long fishing cruise. There had been no really
fine fish in the house for more than a week.</p>
<p>For some little time, while she regained her
poise, Pearl sat admiring her catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got you,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden her face clouded. &ldquo;After
all,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing, catching
a fish. The grand old times are gone. Nothing
ever really happens. If only I&rsquo;d lived in
the days of great, great, great grandfather
Josia Bracket. Those were the brave days!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>As she closed her eyes she seemed to see
Casco Bay as it had been in the pioneer times
when the first Bracket landed there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No houses, no stores, no steamships,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;No city of Portland, no summer
tourists, no ferry boats. Only a cabin here,
another there, woods and water and skulking
Indians, and the whole wide world to live and
fight in. What wonderful days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she opened her eyes she started. As if
willing to conform to her wishes, nature had
blotted out the present as far as that might be
done. A heavy fog drifting silently in from the
sea had hidden the wharves and storage houses
in Portland Harbor, and the homes that line
the shore of Peak&rsquo;s Island. Even the cliffs
that formed Witches Cove were growing shadowy
and unreal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>A fog, however, be it ever so dense, cannot
shut out all signs of progress. A moment had
passed when the ding-dong of a bell reached
her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed, shaking her fist at
the bell buoy which, however invisible through
the fog, kept up its steady ding-dong. &ldquo;There
now! You&rsquo;ve gone and spoiled it all. I&rsquo;d like
to tie my sweater about your noisy tongue!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course that won&rsquo;t do. The boat
from Booth Bay Harbor will be passing in an
hour or two. If this fog keeps up, the pilot
will need your noisy voice to guide him
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of
fussing? Fish a little longer, then go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She settled back in the bow of her light
dory, with the prow tilting at a rakish angle,
baited her hook and cast the line overboard.</p>
<p>Fishing wasn&rsquo;t likely to be over exciting
now. She had made her record catch. Never
before had she landed one so large and fine.
What she wanted most of all was to sit and
dream a while, to dream of the brave deeds of
long ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>And such a time to dream! Even the cliffs
twenty yards away were lost to her sight now.
A ring of white fog, her boat and her own
little self, that was all there was to her present
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians over there on Peak&rsquo;s Island,&rdquo; she
told herself, still dreaming. &ldquo;Indians and some
French. Settlers on Portland Head all crowded
into the stockade. Going to be a battle. Some
soldiers in a big ship anchored far out. They
don&rsquo;t know. A message is needed. I&rsquo;ll go in
my little dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please be still!&rdquo; she exclaimed as
the bell buoy clanged louder than ever as a
great swell came sweeping in from the sea.</p>
<p>The bell did not keep still. <i>Ding-dong,
Ding-dong, Ding-dong</i>, it spoke of cliffs and
shallows and of a channel between that was
safe, wide and deep.</p>
<p>The girl gave her attention to fishing. Cunners
took her bait. She caught a small one, but
threw him back. A great old cod, red with iodine
from the kelp, gave her a thrill. He
snapped at her bait, snagged on the hook, then
shook himself free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s cod beside
chicken halibut? Wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off. The ding-dong of that
buoy bell never had sounded so near before.</p>
<p><i>Ding-dong, Ding-dong.</i> It seemed to be at
her very side. She gave a pull at her anchor
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast enough,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Not drifting
toward the buoy. Besides, wouldn&rsquo;t drift
that way. Tide&rsquo;s setting out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big red cod or another of his sort
claimed her attention. She teased him by bobbing
bait up and down. She loaded the hook
with juicy clams and tried again. This time
it seemed that success must crown her efforts.
The fish was hooked. She began reeling in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beauty!&rdquo; she whispered as a great red
head appeared close to the surface. And then,
with a last mighty effort, the fish tore himself
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p><i>Ding-dong, Ding-dong.</i></p>
<p>She started, looked about, then stood
straight up to stare open mouthed at what she
saw.</p>
<p>And at that moment, faint and from far away
there came the hoarse hoot of the fog horn on
the steamer from Booth Bay Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred passengers on that boat,&rdquo; she
thought as her heart stood still, &ldquo;perhaps two
hundred, three hundred people, men, women
and children, many little children coming home
from a joyous vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked again at the thing she had seen
and could scarcely believe her eyes.</p>
<p>Dim, indistinct but unmistakable, had appeared
the outline of a steel frame, and at its
center a large bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a ghost,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no ghost!&rdquo; Instantly she sprang
into action. Cutting her fish line, she allowed
it to drift. Dragging up her dripping anchor,
she dropped it into the boat. Then, gripping
the oars, she put all her strength into a dozen
strokes that brought her with a bump against
the side of the steel frame from which the bell
hung suspended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The next thing she did was strange, indeed.
Having removed her heavy wool sweater, she
wrapped it tightly about the clapper of the
bell, then tied it securely there with a stout
cod line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; she said, breathing heavily as
she sank to a sitting position on one of the
hollow steel floats that prevented the bell and
its frame from sinking. &ldquo;Now, perhaps you
will keep still and let me dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly attempting
to stand up. &ldquo;The dory&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. In her haste to muffle the bell,
she had failed to tie her painter securely. Now
it had drifted away into the fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to dream now,&rdquo; she told herself ruefully.
&ldquo;May never do anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To one who knows little of the ways of boats
and buoys and other things belonging to the
sea, the girl&rsquo;s acts might seem madness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>They were not. By some mischance, the
chain fastened to a huge rock at the bottom
of the channel, which held the bell buoy to its
place, had given way. The bell buoy still clanging
its message, now a false message indeed,
was drifting out to sea. If the S. S. Standish,
the Booth Bay Harbor steamer, were guided
by this false message catastrophe would befall
her. With all on board she would go crashing
into a cliff or be piled upon some rocky
shoal.</p>
<p>Pearl could see it all, just as it would happen.
A terrible crash, then unutterable confusion.
Men shouting, children crying, women
praying, seamen struggling and the black sea
closing down upon a sinking ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, thank God,&rdquo; she said fervently,
&ldquo;it shall not be. Not hearing the bell, having
no sure guide, they will stand away till the
fog lifts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Then of a sudden her heart went cold and
beads of perspiration started out on her forehead.
What was to come of her? With her
dory gone, she was going straight out to sea
on the frame of a drifting buoy. What chance
could there be?</p>
<p>A moment of calm thought, a whispered
prayer, and she shut the thought from her
mind. She was doing her plain duty. She was
in God&rsquo;s care. That was enough.</p>
<p>The hoot of the steamer&rsquo;s fog horn sounded
louder. Nearer and nearer they came. They
had passed the Witch Rock bell in safety.
There was need of Pearl&rsquo;s bell buoy now.</p>
<p>Of a sudden she caught the clang of the bell,
the pilot&rsquo;s signal for half speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s missed the bell. They are safe. They&rsquo;ll
lay outside until the fog lifts. Thank-thank
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still she drifted out to sea. But her own
peril was lost in great joy because of the safety
of others.</p>
<p>Another jangling of bells. Quarter speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>A thought struck her all of a heap. Hastily
unwrapping the bell clapper of the buoy, she
struck the bell a sharp tap. Again, again and
yet again this strange signal sounded. It was
the pilot&rsquo;s signal for half speed.</p>
<p>Three times she repeated it. Then came the
ship&rsquo;s bell with the same signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They heard,&rdquo; she whispered tensely.</p>
<p>Then, with a throbbing heart, she sent out
in Morse signals the call for help, S. O. S.</p>
<p>There sounded the rattle of chains. They
were lowering a boat.</p>
<p>Moments of silence followed, then from out
the fog there came,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweeter words were never heard by any girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy there!&rdquo; she called back.</p>
<p>A moment more, and four astonished seamen
stared at a girl riding a drifting buoy.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;What you doing on the buoy?&rdquo; said the
kind-hearted and grateful captain as Pearl
climbed aboard the steamer and was surrounded
by curious passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;I was fishing. I caught a chicken
halibut and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Of a sudden her eyes went wide; her dory
and chicken halibut were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, go on,&rdquo; said the eager members
of the group. She succeeded in finishing her
story, but all through the telling there flashed
into her mind the picture of her dory and the
only chicken halibut she had ever caught,
drifting out to sea.</p>
<p>All up and down the deck, as they waited
for the fog to lift, grateful passengers and
crew repeated the girl&rsquo;s story. And always at
the end they added, &ldquo;Lost her fish. Lost her
dory. Too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young lady,&rdquo; a gruff Irish voice said
as Pearl spun round to listen, &ldquo;you seem born
to adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl found herself looking into the eyes
of Captain Patrick O&rsquo;Connor, he of the pirate
crew of the <i>Black Gull</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she replied in uncertain tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay by this, young lady,&rdquo; the Captain went
on, &ldquo;that buoy chain was cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certain was. Them buoys are inspected
regular. Look! They&rsquo;ve brought the buoy
alongside. They&rsquo;re hoistin&rsquo; her on board.
Mark my word, the chain&rsquo;s not worn much, not
enough to cause her to break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not. As they examined the end of the
chain, they found no marks of hammer, file
or hack-saw, but the last link was nearly as
perfect as when first forged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they wouldn&rsquo;t leave the cut link
to tell on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor leaned over to whisper
in the girl&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re told on sure
enough, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But-but&mdash;&rdquo; the girl stammered, trying in
vain to understand, &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t found it, if I
hadn&rsquo;t silenced its lying tongue, you&rsquo;d have
gone on the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we would, young lady. And there&rsquo;s
them hidin&rsquo; away along these here waters as
would have been glad to see it. There&rsquo;s twenty-four
men aboard this ship, that&rsquo;s hated
worse than death by some.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here in the corner,&rdquo; he bent
low to whisper in her ear, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you a
few things. You&rsquo;re old enough to know &rsquo;em,
old enough and wise enough to help some,
I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story he told her was one of smugglers
uncaught, of goods brought in without
duty, and of men refused right of entry into
the United States who, nevertheless, were
here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They land from somewhere, somehow, in
Portland Harbor, or in Casco Bay,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our duty, the duty of every good American,
to find out how and where they come
from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your cousin Ruth told you about
seeing us pirates the other night?&rdquo; he said,
leaning close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s heart leaped. Was a secret
to be told? Yes, here it came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wasn&rsquo;t real pirates; you guessed that.
It was only a blind, a masquerade party, but
a party with as firm a purpose as ever American
patriot ever held. We&rsquo;re bound together,
us twenty-four, in a solemn vow to rid Casco
Bay of this menace to our land. And you can
help, for a girl sees things sometimes that men
never get near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pearl.</p>
<p>She wanted to tell of the bolts of cloth on
the wood schooner, of the dory in the night
and the face in the fire. &ldquo;But those,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;are more Ruth&rsquo;s secrets than mine.
I&rsquo;ll wait and ask her first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the fog was clearing. The rocks
of Cushing&rsquo;s Island and the shore line of
Peak&rsquo;s Island were showing through. Very
soon they were moving slowly forward. Before
Pearl knew it, they were at the dock in
Portland Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; said the Captain of the <i>Standish</i>,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;d like a few facts to enter in our log.
Will you please come to my cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very much confused at being the guest of so
great a man, Pearl found it hard to answer
questions intelligently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>When at last the ordeal was over, the Captain
led her to the steamer&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down there,&rdquo; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new dory, all green and red!&rdquo; said Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a halibut,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;You lost
a halibut, didn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dory and fish are yours,&rdquo; he said
gruffly. &ldquo;Present from passengers and crew.
Little token of&mdash;of&mdash;Oh, hang it, girl! Climb
down and show us you can row her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearl went down a rope ladder like a
monkey. A moment later, waving a joyous,
tearful farewell to her new friends, she turned
the shining dory&rsquo;s prow toward home and
rowed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />OFF FOR FURTHER ADVENTURE</h2>
<p>Pearl returned home that evening to find
a door to new and strange adventure standing
wide open before her.</p>
<p>Donald, her brother, was seated before a
small fire in the low old-fashioned fireplace at
the back of their living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don!&rdquo; she cried joyously. &ldquo;You home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo; Big, broad shouldered, sea tanned,
Don turned to smile at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don, I caught a halibut, a twenty-five
pounder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t. It went out to sea in my dory.
But Don! I&rsquo;ve got a new dory and a bigger
halibut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Don rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don after inspecting the dory
fore and aft, and listening to her story, &ldquo;is a
right fine dory, staunch and seaworthy. I&rsquo;d
like to take it to Monhegan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monhegan?&rdquo; Pearl&rsquo;s heart gave a great
leap. Monhegan! The dream island of every
coast child&rsquo;s heart. Don was going there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;Swordfishing is played
out, and the canners have all the horse mackeral
they can use this season. I&rsquo;ve decided to
pack my lobster traps on the sloop and go up
about there somewhere, mebby only Booth
Bay Harbor. All depends. They say lobster
catches are fine on the shoals up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Don,&rdquo; Pearl&rsquo;s eyes shone with a new
hope, &ldquo;if you take my dory, you&rsquo;ll take me.
You won&rsquo;t spend all your time tending lobster
pots. There&rsquo;s fine fishing up there. I caught
a halibut. You&rsquo;ll take me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Don, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I might.
You&rsquo;d get lonesome, though. Nobody but me
and you and the sea; that is, nobody that we
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Ruth, too,&rdquo; Pearl said quickly. &ldquo;You
should have heard her talk about Monhegan
over there by the old fort. She&rsquo;ll be wild to
go. And she is considerable of a fisherman,
good as most men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don considered the proposition. Ruth was
his cousin. They had been much together on
the sea. Unlike his dreamy little sister, she
had always been able and practical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
she shouldn&rsquo;t go, if she wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth was overjoyed at the prospect. She
had no trouble in obtaining permission to go,
for, though Don had barely turned twenty, he
was known as one of the ablest seamen on all
Casco Bay, and no one feared to sail with him.</p>
<p>So, one day when the sky was clear and the
water a sheet of blue, they rounded the island
and went scudding away toward the island of
many dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>As old Fort Skammel faded from their
sight, Ruth thought of the unsolved mystery
hidden there and resolved to delve more deeply
into it as soon as she returned from this trip.</p>
<p>Someone has said that all of life is closely
interwoven, that warp and woof, it is all one.
Certainly this at times appears to be true.
There was that lurking in the immediate future
which was to connect experiences at Monhegan
with the old fort&rsquo;s hidden secret. But
this for a time was hidden by the veil of the
future which ever hangs like a fog just before
us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />SOME LOBSTERS</h2>
<p>It was strange. As Donald Bracket shaded
his eyes to peer into the driving fog he seemed
to see a face. The muscles of that face were
twisted into a smile. Not a pleasant smile, it
came near being a leer.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no face; only an after
image that had somehow crept up from the
shadowy recesses of his brain. A very vivid
image, it remained there against the fog for
many seconds before it slowly faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Tomingo,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
fairly spooky, as if he had sent us out to get
into this mess, knowing we&rsquo;d fall into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he thought a moment later as
he steered his sloop square into the heart of a
great wave, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t know. No one could
foretell such a storm four days in advance.
Besides, he couldn&rsquo;t count on my coming out
this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; He caught his breath. Cutting
its way through the crest of the wave, his
twenty-foot fishing boat went plunging down
the other side. For a matter of seconds the
air about him was all white spray. This passed,
but the driving fog remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing the canvas is there.&rdquo; He tightened
a rope that held a protecting canvas
across the prow of his boat. &ldquo;Be dangerous to
get one&rsquo;s motor wet in such a blow. Might be
fatal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, wrinkling his brow, he stared
into the fog. &ldquo;Wish I could sight Monhegan.
Wish&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exclamation escaped his lips. He drew
his hands hastily across his eyes. The face,
the crafty smile, were there again. The lips appeared
to move. They seemed to be saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The shoal is just there. Plenty da lobsters.
Plenty big. Wanta go. Boat too small, mine.
Too far froma da shore. Plenty da lobster.
Get reech queek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, he told the truth,&rdquo; Don said
to himself. &ldquo;There are lobsters aplenty.&rdquo; He
glanced down at a crate where a mass of legs,
eyes and great green pinchers squirmed and
twisted while the boat, worried by the ever increasing
storm, rolled and pitched like a bit of
drift in a mountain cataract.</p>
<p>He threw a look at the two water drenched
girls, Pearl and Ruth, who sat huddled in the
prow, and his brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to get out of this,&rdquo; he told himself,
taking a fresh grip on his steering stick. &ldquo;Only
question is, where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That indeed was the question. Fifteen miles
to the westward was the mainland and rocky
shores little known to him. He was far from
his usual fishing ground. Somewhere out there
in the fog, perhaps very near, scarcely a mile
long, a mere granite boulder jutting out of
the sea, was the island called Monhegan.
Smaller rocks jutting up from the sea formed
a safe harbor for this island. Once there he
could weather the storm in safety. Again he
shaded his eyes to peer into the fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>For a full moment, with straining eyes, he
stood there motionless. Then of a sudden a
sigh of satisfaction escaped his lips. Towering
a hundred or more feet above the sea, a bold
headline loomed before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Head,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touching his lever, he set his boat at a slight
angle to the rushing waves, then took a deep
breath. The battle was begun, not finished.
The channel that led to Monhegan&rsquo;s cozy harbor
was narrow. It was guarded by nature&rsquo;s
sentinels&mdash;black and frowning rocks on one
side, reefs booming and white on the other.
Many a stauncher boat than his had turned
back before these perils. The rocky shore of
Monhegan has taken its toll of lives all down
the years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be a battle,&rdquo; he exulted, &ldquo;and I
shall win!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>In the meantime, while his immediate attention
was devoted to the present struggle, the
questions regarding Tomingo and the lobster
industry were revolving themselves in the back
of his mind.</p>
<p>They, the three of them, Don, Ruth and
Pearl, had reached the mainland nearest to the
island of Monhegan, Booth Bay Harbor, in
safety. There they had taken up their abode
in an abandoned fisherman&rsquo;s shack. Shortly
after that Don had met Tomingo.</p>
<p>To Tomingo he had confided his plans for
lobster trapping. Tomingo had told him of the
reef far out from the mainland, but near Monhegan,
where the lobster fishing was unusually
good. Without thinking much about it, he had
followed the tip. The weather had been fine.
Having piled his motor boat high with lobster
pots, he had gone pop-popping away toward
Monhegan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>He had experienced no difficulty in finding
the long sunken reef Tomingo had pointed out
on the chart. He had baited his pots with codfish
heads, then dropped them one by one
along the reef. After adjusting the bright red
floats, each marked with his initials, he had
cast an appraising eye along the tossing string
of them, then turned his boat&rsquo;s prow toward
his shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen miles is a long way to come for lobsters,&rdquo;
he had thought to himself. &ldquo;But the
reefs close in are fished out. If the catch is
good I&rsquo;ll do well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A two days&rsquo; storm had kept him from his
traps. The morning of this, the third day, had
promised fair weather; so with his sister and
cousin on board, he had ventured out. Nature
had kept but half her promise. Fair weather
had continued while he was visiting the shoal.
The work of lifting the traps had been particularly
difficult. Ruth had given him a ready
hand at this. Six traps were fairly loaded with
lobsters. A seventh had been torn in pieces by
a fifteen pound codfish that had blundered into
it. Another trap had been demolished by a
dogfish. All the other traps had yielded a fair
harvest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was a good catch,&rdquo; the boy told
himself as he thought of it now. &ldquo;Never had
a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that Tomingo,&rdquo; he thought again.
&ldquo;Why did he tell me about it, me, a stranger
and an American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, indeed, was a question worthy of consideration.
The conflict between native born
and foreign born fishermen all along the Maine
coast has for many long years been a hard-fought
and bitter one. At times floats have
been cut and traps set adrift and sharp battles
fought with fists and clubbed oars. It seemed
inconceivable, now that he thought of it, that
any foreigner should have told him of this rich
fishing ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;that Tomingo&rsquo;s
boat is smaller and less seaworthy than mine.
I wouldn&rsquo;t want to come this far in it myself.
But some of his friends and fellow countrymen
have far better boats than mine. Why
should they not fish that shoal?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>He could not answer this question. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a trick in it somewhere, I&rsquo;ll be bound, and I&rsquo;ll
find it soon enough without doubt. Meanwhile
there is business at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, indeed, there was. The frowning rocks
of Black Head, Burnt Head and Skull Rock
loomed squarely before him. He had been told
enough to know that this was the back of the
island, that he must round the point to the left,
circle half about the island and enter from the
other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be a hard pull,&rdquo; he said, setting
his teeth hard, &ldquo;but if the old engine stays
with me I&rsquo;ll make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The memory of that next hour will remain
with the boy as long as the stars shine down
upon him and the sun brightens his mornings.</p>
<p>The wind, the fog, the storm, the falling
night. Above the roar of the sea a long-drawn
voice, hoarse and insistent, never ending, the
voice of Manana, the great fog horn that,
driven by great engines, watched over night
and day, warned of rocky shoals and disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>With that voice sounding in his ears, with
damp spray cutting sharply across his face,
with his light craft like a frightened rabbit
leaping from wave to wave, he steered clear of
Black Head, White Head and Skull Rock, to
round the point and come swinging round toward
the narrow entrance where he would
find safe haven or a grave.</p>
<p>He was heading for what he believed to be
the channel when a light creeping slowly
across the sky caught and held his attention.
It was growing dark now, difficult to see ten
yards before him. He needed to get in at once.
For all this, the mysterious light intrigued
him. Beginning at the right, it moved slowly
over a narrow arc against the black sky. Pausing
for the merest fraction of a second, it appeared
to retrace its way over an invisible
celestial way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; For a moment he was
bewildered. Then, like a flash it came to him.
He was looking at the crest of the great rock
that lay before Monhegan. On Monhegan a
powerful light was set. As it played backward
and forward it tinged the crest of Manana, as
the rock was called, with a faint halo of glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a boon to the sailor!&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;What real heroes are those who live on this
bleak island winter and summer! What&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke straight off. Before him
he had caught an appalling sound, the rush of
surf beating upon a rocky shoal.</p>
<p>Reflected from Manana, a single gleam of
light gave him further warning. The shoals
were just before him. The waves there were
breaking mountain high. Turning his boat
squarely about, he set his engine to doing its
best and trusted himself to the trough of a
wave. Instantly there came a drenching crash
of cold black water.</p>
<p>He clung desperately to his course. Any
moment the engine, deluged by a greater sea,
might go dead. Then would come the end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no other way.&rdquo; He set his teeth
hard.</p>
<p>Once more he caught the moving gleam
across the sky. That gleam saved him. He
held to a course perpendicular to its line of
motion as long as he dared. Then, swinging
through a quarter circle he shot straight ahead.
Five minutes later, drenched to the skin, panting
from excitement and well nigh exhausted,
but now quite safe, he ran his boat alongside
a punt where a yellow light gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said a voice. A lantern held high
revealed a boyish face. &ldquo;Pretty lucky you got
in. Nasty night. Some blow!&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have made it,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;only
I caught the gleam on the crest of Manana. It
guided me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie up,&rdquo; invited the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you
ashore in my punt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you got there?&rdquo; he asked in a surprised
tone as the light of his lantern fell upon
the crate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lobsters,&rdquo; said Don.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lobsters?&rdquo; The boy let out a whistle of
surprise. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a shoal, little way out.&rdquo; Don hadn&rsquo;t
meant to tell that. He hadn&rsquo;t liked the sound
of that whistle. He spoke before he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better watch out,&rdquo; said the other
boy. Then without allowing time for further
remarks, &ldquo;All set? Hop in then. I got to go
ashore. The gang will be looking for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the young stranger rowed the two girls
and Don ashore, Don wondered over his
strange warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better look out!&rdquo; What could he have
meant? He wanted to ask. Natural reserve
held him back.</p>
<p>Only once during the short journey was the
silence broken. They were passing a boat covered
with canvas and sunk to the gunwale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; Don asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lobster pond. Keep lobsters there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they keep them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are a hundred or more of us summer
folks out here,&rdquo; the other boy explained. &ldquo;We
like a lobster salad now and then. They keep
them for us. Mighty decent of them to bother.
A fine lot, these fishermen. Real sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don thought it strange that lobsters should
be kept when there was a steady market for
them and they were to be caught out here with
comparative ease. However, he asked no
further questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the lift.&rdquo; He stood looking up
at the few lights that gleamed through the
fog. &ldquo;Suppose I&rsquo;ll have to stay here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose so. I&rsquo;d take you to our cottage,
but it&rsquo;s small. We&rsquo;re full up. Couldn&rsquo;t crowd
one more in an end. There&rsquo;s a summer hotel
up yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summer hotel. Four dollars up. Society
folks.&rdquo; Don looked down at his sodden garments.
&ldquo;No, thanks. Where do the fisherfolk
live? I&rsquo;m one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The boy appeared surprised.
&ldquo;Captain Field lives just down there beyond
the wharf. But you wouldn&rsquo;t go there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t? Why not?&rdquo; Something in the
other boy&rsquo;s tone angered Donald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s tone was
sharp. He turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re dumb. That&rsquo;s all I have to say
for you. You&rsquo;re breaking into the closed season
on lobsters. You couldn&rsquo;t do anything
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closed season!&rdquo; Don&rsquo;s eyes opened
wide. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. There&rsquo;s no closed season
on lobsters, not in the State of Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monhegan there is, and believe me it&rsquo;s
tight closed. Try it out and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would have to be a law. No one
owns the shoals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess if you lived on this rocky island winter
and summer, heat, cold, supplies, no supplies,
if you took it all as it came, you&rsquo;d feel
that you owned the shoals. That&rsquo;s the way the
folks here feel. They want time to fish for cod
and take summer parties about, so they haul
up their traps and call June to November a
closed season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The other boy&rsquo;s tone was kindly
now. &ldquo;You seem a decent sort. I don&rsquo;t know
what got you out here. But you go back. Take
your traps with you. When people live in a
place like this they&rsquo;ve got a right to make a
few laws. Know those Italian fishermen over
at the Bay?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one of them. Tomingo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomingo. That&rsquo;s his name. He&rsquo;s their
leader. They tried trapping on the Monhegan
shoals. Know what happened? Someone cut
their floats. Never found their traps, nor the
lobsters in &rsquo;em. Goodnight. Wish you luck.&rdquo;
The boy disappeared into the fog.</p>
<p>So that was it! And that was why Tomingo
was so willing to direct him to rich lobster
fields! Don sat limply down upon a rock. The
two girls stood staring at him in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to keep us off any ground he
might wish to trap on, and wanted to repay a
debt to these Monheganites,&rdquo; he said to his
companions.</p>
<p>For five minutes he sat there enshrouded in
fog, buried in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Closed season!&rdquo; he exploded at last. &ldquo;What
nonsense! Who ever heard of such a thing?
Of course, we won&rsquo;t pay any attention to it.
And if they cut my floats I&rsquo;ll have them in jail
for it. There are laws enough against that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this resolve firmly fixed in his mind,
but with an uneasy feeling lurking there as
well, he thought once more of supper and a
bed for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to this Captain Field&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he
said to the girls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him I am a fisherman
from Peak&rsquo;s Island. That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ll get an
early start in the morning. He need never
know about my catch of lobsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this settled in his mind he led the way
round the bank, across the wharf and up the
grass grown path that led to the dimly gleaming
light that shone from Captain Field&rsquo;s window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>A half hour later, with thoughts of the forbidden
lobsters crowded far back in the hidden
recesses of their minds, the trio found themselves
doing full justice to great steaming
bowls of clam chowder topped by a wedge of
native blueberry pie.</p>
<p>All this time and for a long while after, Don
talked of sails and fishing, nets, harpoons, and
long sea journeys with his smiling, lean-faced
and fit appearing host. Captain Field, though
still a young man, had earned his papers well,
for he had sailed the Atlantic in every type of
craft and had once shipped as a harpooner on a
swordfishing boat outfitted in Portland harbor.</p>
<p>As they talked Don&rsquo;s eyes roved from corner
to corner of the cabin. Everything within was
scrupulously clean, but painfully plain, much
of it hand hewn with rough and ready tools.</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, the young Captain
smiled as he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a lot of money to be had on
Monhegan. The ground&rsquo;s too rough for farming
or cattle. We fish in summer and trap lobsters
in winter. But we must have an eye on
the purse strings every day of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said this a curly-haired girl of eight
and a brown-faced boy of six came to kneel by
their mother&rsquo;s knee to say their goodnight
prayers.</p>
<p>As he bowed his head with them, something
very like a stab ran through Don&rsquo;s heart and
a voice seemed to whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a thief. You are robbing these little
ones and their honest parents of their
bread. They endure all the hardships of the
year. You come to reap a golden harvest from
their lobster fields while their backs are
turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He retired soon after. The bed they gave
him was a good one. He was tired, yet he did
not sleep. For a full hour he thrashed about.
Then a sudden resolve put him to rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>As is the way with persons endowed with
particularly splendid physique, Ruth, in the
broad rope bed beside her cousin, fell asleep
at once. She had wrestled long that day with
trap lines. The struggle to reach shore had
been fatiguing. Her sleep was sweet and
dreamless.</p>
<p>Not so with Pearl. Her mind ever filled with
fancy, was now overflowing. She was now on
Monhegan, the island of her dreams. She recalled
as if they were told yesterday the tales
she had heard told of this island by her seafaring
uncle before she was old enough to go
to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle,&rdquo; she had cried. &ldquo;Take me there!
Take me to Monhegan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day, child,&rdquo; he had promised.</p>
<p>Alas, poor man, he had not lived to fulfill
his promise. Like many another brave fisherman,
he had lost his life on the dreary banks
of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Uncle,&rdquo; she whispered as her throat
tightened, &ldquo;now I am here. Here! And I know
you must be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>The storm was still on. She could hear the
distant beat of waves on Black Head, Burnt
Head and Skull Rock. The great fog horn still
sent out its message from Manana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoo-who-ee-Whoo-oo!&rdquo; Sometimes rising,
sometimes falling, it seemed a measureless human
voice shouting in the night. The sound of
it was haunting.</p>
<p>Rising and wrapping a blanket about her,
the girl went to the low window sill, to drop
upon the floor and sit there staring into the
night.</p>
<p>There was little enough to see. The night
was black. But across the crest of that great
rock, the spot of light played incessantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen miles out to sea,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;Seems strange. One does not feel that this
house rested on land. It is more as if this were
a ship&rsquo;s cabin, the lighthouse our search light,
the fog horn our signal, and we sail on and on
into the night. We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was awakened from this dream by an
unfamiliar sound, thundering that was not
waves beating a shore, that might have been
the roar of the distant battle front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>A moment passed, and then she knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A seaplane,&rdquo; she thought suddenly. &ldquo;And
on such a night! Why, that can mean only
one thing, a trans-Atlantic flyer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How her heart leaped at the thought! She
recalled with a tremor the day she got news of
&ldquo;Lindy&rsquo;s marvelous achievement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such flyers had become fairly common now.
Yet she had never seen one in his flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he comes near enough,&rdquo; she said to herself,
straining her eyes in a vain attempt to
pierce the inky blackness of the night.</p>
<p>Then a new thought striking her all of a
heap set her shuddering. &ldquo;What if he does
not realize he is near Monhegan? If he is flying
low, he will crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily a little prayer went up for the
lone navigator of the night air.</p>
<p>Nor was the prayer unheeded. As she looked
a dark spot appeared over Manana. Then the
plane came into full view. As if set to the task,
the light from the island beacon followed the
aviator in his flight. Ten seconds he was in
full view. Then he was gone, passed on into
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, catching her
breath, &ldquo;How&mdash;how strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing she had seen <i>was</i> strange. A
broad-winged seaplane with a wide fusilage
that might have been a cabin for carrying three
or four passengers, had passed. The strange
part of it all was that it was painted the dull
gray-green of a cloudy sea, and carried not one
single insignia of any nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Flying Dutchman of the air,&rdquo; she
thought as a thrill ran up her spine.</p>
<p>For a long time she sat there staring at the
darkness of night that had swallowed up the
mysterious ship of the air.</p>
<p>At last, with a shudder, for the night air of
Monhegan is chill even in summer, she rose to
creep beneath the blankets beside her sleeping
companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>She was about to drift away to the land of
dreams, when she thought of Captain O&rsquo;Connor
and what he had told her of smugglers
along the Maine coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;But no! One
would not risk his life crossing the ocean in a
seaplane just to smuggle in a few hundred dollars&rsquo;
worth of lace or silk or whatever it might
be. &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be worth the cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But men,&rdquo; she thought quite suddenly. &ldquo;He
said something about smuggling men into the
country. It might be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were drooping. The day had been
long. The salt sea air lay heavy upon her. She
fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was a little dark when Don arose. The
girls were still asleep. Somewhat to his surprise,
as he reached the beach he found the
boy of the previous night there before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep here?&rdquo; he asked good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; There was something in Don&rsquo;s
look that made this boy like him. &ldquo;Going so
soon? Want me to take you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Captain Field&rsquo;s lobster pond?&rdquo;
Don asked as the punt bumped the side of his
boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That green one.&rdquo; The boy opened his eyes
wide. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Give me a lift, will you?&rdquo; Don
was tugging at the crate of lobsters in the bottom
of his motor boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he sighed as the crate dropped into
the punt. &ldquo;Just row me over to the Field lobster
pond, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once there, to the boy&rsquo;s astonishment, Don
loosed the lacings of the canvas on Field&rsquo;s lobster
pond, then one at a time he took the lobsters
from his crate and dropped them into the
pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He buy them from you?&rdquo; The younger boy
was incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You quitting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you for that.&rdquo; The other boy put out
a hand. For a second Don gripped it. Then,
together they rowed back to the motor boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The sea was calm now. Twirling the wheel
to his motor, Don went pop-popping away to
his lobster traps. Having lifted these, he piled
them high on the deck, then turned his prow
once more toward Monhegan. His lobster fishing
days on Monhegan shoals were at an end.
But he was not going to leave Monhegan, not
just yet. The wild charm of the place had got
him. Strange and startling things were yet to
greet him there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />FROM OUT THE FOG</h2>
<p>Despite the fog that lay low over the water,
the sea was choppy. The fisherman who rode
in the improvised crow&rsquo;s nest in the forward
rigging of the fishing sloop rose ten feet in
air to fall, then to rise and fall again. There
was a tossing, whirling motion that would
have made most girls deathly sick. Not so this
one; for the fisherman who stood there ever
gripping the harpoon, with alert eyes watching,
ever watching the narrow circle of fogbound
ocean, was Ruth.</p>
<p>Swordfish had been reported off Monhegan;
in fact Captain Field had brought in a modest-sized
one only the day before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Although Don and the two girls had decided
that lobster trapping on the Monhegan shoals
was unfair to those daring souls who made
their home on these wave-beaten shores, they
were spending a few days on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May never be here again,&rdquo; Don had said.
&ldquo;From all I can see, it&rsquo;s not quite like anything
on earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Booth Bay on the mail tug.
The sea has calmed down quite a bit. If you
girls want to have a try at something, deep
sea cod, horse mackerel, or even swordfish,
why there&rsquo;s the sloop. Safe enough as long&rsquo;s
you keep in sound of the fog horn or sight of
the island. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because swordfishing is quite the most
thrilling type of fishing on all the coast, and
because these huge battlers of the deep bring
a marvelous price when caught, Ruth had
elected to go swordfishing. And here they
were.</p>
<p>There was some fog, but as long as the
hoarse <i>Whoo-whooo-oo</i> of the fog horn on Manana
sounded in their ears, they were safe.
That sound would guide them back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Dressed as she was in faded knickers and a
ragged lumberjack, with a boy&rsquo;s cap pulled
down tight over her unruly locks, one might
easily have taken this stalwart girl of the
Maine coast for a boy, or, at the distance, even
for a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we won&rsquo;t see any to-day,&rdquo; she shouted
back to Pearl at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thickening up,&rdquo; Pearl replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May burn off later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might drop anchor and try for cod,&rdquo;
said Ruth. &ldquo;There are lines and bait in the
forward cabin. We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke short off to stare away to the
right. The next second she gripped her harpoon
more securely as she uttered a command
almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>The capable hands of her sixteen-year-old
cousin gave the wheel a turn. The boat bore
away to the right. The look on Pearl&rsquo;s face
became animated. She knew what the command
meant. A great fish of one sort or another
had broken water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a horse mackerel,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Might be a swordfish, though. If it is&mdash;if
she gets him! Oh, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls had not been harpooning
often, so this little adventure was a real treat.
Even a horse mackerel would be worth something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a swordfish,&rdquo; Pearl told herself with a
real thrill, &ldquo;one of them may be worth a hundred
dollars. And oh, boy! think of the thrill
of the chase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big girl in the crow&rsquo;s nest was not
dreaming. With blue eyes intent, with the
color in her cheek heightened with excitement,
she was studying an object that, now lifting
on the crest of a wave, showed black against
the skyline and now, with scarcely a perceptible
motion, disappeared beneath the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw a fish behave like that,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Acts like a log&mdash;almost&mdash;not quite.
A log does not go under unless a wave hits it.
This thing does. Shaped like a swordfish. But
whoever heard of a swordfish acting that
way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Once more she turned her head to broadcast
an order in a tone that was all but a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a swordfish,&rdquo; she whispered back, ten
seconds later. &ldquo;I saw his sword. He&rsquo;s a monster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A swordfish! Her mind was in a whirl. Suppose
they got him! A hundred dollars. What
did it not mean to those fisherfolk! A new suit
for her father, a dress for herself, a new stove
for the kitchen and perhaps a new punt. They
needed a new one badly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A swordfish! It is! It is!&rdquo; Her heart
pounded furiously against her ribs as the boat
came closer, ever closer to that languid black
monster that now rising, now sinking, seemed
half asleep.</p>
<p>A moment passed. Pearl caught the black
gleam before her, and her eyes shone as her
tense muscles gripped the wheel. Pearl was
standing up now. Breathlessly she waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>As for the girl in the crow&rsquo;s nest, for the
first time in her life she was experiencing
&ldquo;buck fever.&rdquo; Little wonder. Never before had
she cast for a swordfish, yet here before her a
monster cut the waves. His five-foot sword
dripped with foam as he rolled lazily over and
sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; The tense muscles that had frozen
her hands to the harpoon relaxed.</p>
<p>A minute passed. And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There he is!&rdquo; came in a tense whisper
from the stern.</p>
<p>Towering above the sea, her bronze face
alight, the girl in the crow&rsquo;s nest lifted an arm.
With skill and precision she poised her harpoon,
then let fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him!&rdquo; came from the stern.</p>
<p>Something splashed into the water. An
empty keg sealed up tight and fastened securely
to the harpoon rope, had been thrown
overboard. It would mark the progress of the
struggling fish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>But, strangely enough, the great fish did not
struggle overmuch. After a few wallowing
flounders in an unavailing attempt to break
away from the harpoon line, he went down in
a swirl of foam. A moment later he rose to the
top and swam heavily away.</p>
<p>Pearl knew what to do. She followed the
fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acts awful queer,&rdquo; was the big girl&rsquo;s comment.
A cold dread was gripping her heart.
What if this fish was sick?</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t eat sick fish,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a dead loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No food from the sea is more highly prized
than is the steak of a swordfish. None brings
a higher price in the market. But if the fish
was not sound, then all their work went for
nothing.</p>
<p>What was this? Some strange object was
moving across the surface of the water. Now
on the crest of a wave, it plunged into the
trough, then, like some living thing, climbed
the next wave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be alive,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only a mass of cloth and twisted stick. Something
tailing behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stared at this extraordinary
phenomenon, an inanimate object moving
like a living thing across the water. Then of
a sudden she realized that this curious object
was following the swordfish.</p>
<p>Like a flash it came over her, and her heart
sank. This was a marker, just as her floating
barrel was. Someone had caught the fish before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some of those city folks who make their
summer home on Monhegan,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Been fishing with a kite. That&rsquo;s the remains
of their kite gliding along down there. They
got a fish and have been playing him, tiring
him out. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so sort of dead. Oh!
Gee!&rdquo; She rested her head on her arm and
wanted to cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Angling for swordfish with a kite is a sport
indulged in by expert fishermen all along the
Atlantic coast. A live herring or other fish of
its size is attached to a hook on a line hanging
from a kite. The kite is then sailed from a boat
over the water in such a manner that the live
bait, now beneath the water, now above it,
moves along over the surface like a small flying
fish. The quarry, seeing this tempting
prize, strikes it, then the fight begins. The task
of the sportsman is to tire the great fish out.
Of course, if the slender line is broken the prize
is lost. The battle sometimes lasts for hours.</p>
<p>It was no sad face that Ruth presented to
the yellow oilskin-clad city boy and girl whose
motor boat, the <i>Speed King</i>, soon hove into
view. She wasn&rsquo;t sorry she had spoiled their
game. She was glad. She felt that they had
no right to make play out of what was work to
her and had been to her ancestors for generations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; The city boy
in the prow of the boat lifted a clouded and
angry face to Ruth. To do him full justice, he
had taken her for a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Ruth asked belligerently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harpoon our fish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d I know it was your fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a line on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t see your line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was about done for. We&rsquo;d have had
him in another half hour. We&rsquo;ve been after
him for five hours.&rdquo; The boy held up hands
that were cut and bleeding from handling the
line. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our first one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ruth, and her tone was cold,
&ldquo;since you claim the fish, take him. He won&rsquo;t
give you much trouble now. All I want is my
line and keg. That ought to satisfy you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth knew that it wouldn&rsquo;t satisfy. She
knew all about this sportsman&rsquo;s ideas of
catches. She had murdered their prize. That&rsquo;s
the way they would look at it. If they didn&rsquo;t
take the fish with such and such tackle, so
heavy a line and pole, just such a reel, they had
nothing to boast of. She had spoiled their
game. But she didn&rsquo;t care. They had spoiled
hers, too, and it was more than just a silly
game, it was bread and butter, a new stove,
some new clothes, a&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The boy began to speak again. His words
burned with anger. &ldquo;That don&rsquo;t satisfy us, you
know it don&rsquo;t, you meat hunter you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl with very bright eyes that
rode beside him, tugging at his arm, stopped
the angry flood. She whispered in his ear.
Ruth heard, and her face flushed.</p>
<p>What she had said was, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This made her more angry than ever, but
she controlled her emotions and said no more.</p>
<p>A moment later the <i>Speed King</i> turned
about and left the circle of fog-ridden sea to
Ruth and Pearl and to the great fish that had
ceased to struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ruth, rising wearily from her
place fifteen minutes later, &ldquo;since they don&rsquo;t
seem to want the fish, guess we&rsquo;d better take
him home. He&rsquo;s worth a lot of money, and we
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>There was no spirit in her voice. There was
no spring in her usually buoyant self as she
did the work of dispatching the fish, taking
the keg and lashing the prize for a tow to port.
She had won what she wanted, but now she
had it she was sure she was not going to enjoy
it, not even the new dress.</p>
<p>Late that evening she delivered the prize to
Captain Field, who promised to carry it to
market for her. She wasn&rsquo;t going to get a
great deal of joy out of the money, but one
could not quite throw it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough luck,&rdquo; Don said as she told him
the story that evening. &ldquo;I suppose those city
people must have their sport, but it&rsquo;s a little
hard to understand why one person&rsquo;s sport
should interfere with another&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />OFF BLACK HEAD</h2>
<p>In the meantime, notwithstanding the fact
that Ruth and Pearl were on far away Monhegan,
the old Fort Skammel mystery was not
entirely neglected, nor was the sleepy old fortress
allowed to bask unmolested in the sun.</p>
<p>With her two newly made pals away, Betty
Bronson, who had lived for a long time on the
banks of the romantic Chicago River, and who
had but recently been taken up by a wealthy
benefactress, found life hanging heavy on her
hands. The ladies in the big summer cottage
on the hill, which was her present home, drank
quantities of tea, played numberless games of
bridge, and gossiped as ladies will. All of
which interested Betty not at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Fishing off the dock was not exciting. She
tried for cunners off the rocks at the back of
the island and was promptly and efficiently
drenched from head to toe by an insolent wave.</p>
<p>After three days of this sort of thing she
was prepared for any wild and desperate adventure.
Hiring a punt from Joe Trott, she
rowed across the bay to the old fort.</p>
<p>The day was bright and the bay calm. The
grass by the old fort was as motionless and
silent as were the massive stones which made
up the walls of the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peaceful,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;What could be
more so? Like the schoolhouse by the road,
the old fort is a ragged beggar sunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had she gripped a flashlight and
crept through a narrow square where once a
massive cannon had protruded, than all this
was changed. As if to make reality doubly real,
the sun for a moment passed under a cloud,
and the great silent circular chamber, which
had once known the cannons&rsquo; roar, became
dark at midday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; she shuddered and was tempted to
turn back. Just in time she thought of tea and
bridge. She went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth said it was down these stairs at the
right,&rdquo; she told herself, stepping resolutely
down the ancient stone stairway. &ldquo;Down a
long passage, around a curve, through a small
square dungeon-like place, then along a narrow
passageway. Ooo-oo! That seems a long
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of the face Ruth had seen
in the fire. Just why she expected that face to
remain there, like an oil painting on the floor,
she probably could not have told. Perhaps she
did not expect it. That she did expect to meet
with some adventure, make some discovery, or
experience a thrill was quite certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Ruth were here,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really her mystery; but I&rsquo;ll save it for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she disappeared down the narrow
passageway that led to the dim unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Had she known just what was happening to
Ruth at that moment she would have been surprised
and startled. Ruth was experiencing
adventure all her own.</p>
<p>On that day, still wondering and brooding
over her curious experience with the swordfish
and trying without much success to get
the consent of her mind to enjoy the swordfish
money gotten in such a strange manner, Ruth
had gone for a walk to the back of the island.</p>
<p>Once there, fish and money were driven from
her mind, for the view from the crest of Black
Head, a bold headland towering two hundred
feet above the sea, was glorious beyond compare.
The day was clear. There was no storm,
yet great breakers, racing in from the sea, sent
out long, low rushes of sound as they broke
against the impregnable black barrier.</p>
<p>As her keenly appreciative eyes took in the
long line of fast racing gray-green surf, they
suddenly fell upon a sight that made her blood
run cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What a terrible chance! How&mdash;how foolish!&rdquo;
she exclaimed as, springing from her
rocky seat, she went racing back over the
island.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the head of a rugged trail
that led downward, she came to a sudden
pause.</p>
<p>This, in view of the fact that she honestly
believed that the boy and girl on the rocks by
the rushing surf were in grave danger, might
seem strange. Strange or not, she walked deliberately
now. Dropping here, clinging there
to drop again, she had made her way half the
distance to them when she paused again to at
last take a seat there in the sun.</p>
<p>The path from there on was steep but
straight. She could reach the ones below in
less than a moment&rsquo;s time. But she would not,
at least not yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; she told herself a little
bitterly. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if one didn&rsquo;t
really like them. But I do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>It was a rather strange situation. The boy
and girl who were endangering their lives by
playing in the high rolling surf were the very
ones who had followed the swordfish the day
before.</p>
<p>With her eyes on the shining surf and the
two dancing figures before her, she gave herself
over to reflection.</p>
<p>The boy and girl below were tempting
death. There was no question about it. They
were playing in the surf at an exceedingly dangerous
moment. True, there was no wind, no
storm upon the sea. But there had been a
storm somewhere. That was evident. It might
have happened on the faraway coast of Florida.
No matter, the seas that had risen then
had journeyed northward. Now they were
reaching higher and higher on the sloping rock
where the boy and girl played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think the ocean is a plaything!&rdquo; Ruth
said almost bitterly. Having lived her life in a
fisherman&rsquo;s cabin by the sea, she knew the
ocean was no plaything. Twice in her short
life she had looked into eyes that saw nothing,
on arms that would never move again, lifeless
forms given up by the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>As she watched, in spite of her dislike for
sports that tempted providence, she found herself
fascinated by the wild, nymph-like daring
of the twelve-year-old girl who in a single cotton
garment drenched with salt spray, hatless
and bare of feet, sprang far out after the receding
waves to turn and rush back as the surf
came thundering in.</p>
<p>Now as she watched, the spray hid her. She
sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, no, the spray cleared and the girl,
drenched, chilled but triumphant, threw up her
arms and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can help but like them, these rich
men&rsquo;s children!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They are
frank and fearless. They never quarrel. They
are generous to a fault. And yet&mdash;&rdquo; she paused
for a moment to reflect, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t seem to
have any notion of the value of life. They have
never been taught to be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Not taught to be afraid. That was it. Too
much fear was destructive; too little fear quite
as bad.</p>
<p>Receding, the sea appeared to give up its attempt
to snatch the daring ones to its breast.
Ruth&rsquo;s eyes and thoughts drifted away from
the boy and girl on the rocks. She joyed in the
beauty and power of nature revealed in that
long line of thundering surf. Nowhere in all
her life had she seen such surf as came beating
in at the back of Monhegan.</p>
<p>Great men have felt the charm of it in all
ages. Captain John Smith once tarried to raise
a garden there. Governor Bradford of Plymouth
Plantation was once there. And, at this
very moment, Ruth caught a glimpse of a
shock of white hair which belonged to one of
the greatest inventors of modern times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he is sitting there watching the
surf and trying to estimate the amount of
power that is being wasted,&rdquo; she thought with
a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>But there was the surf again. Booming in
louder than before it sent spray forty feet high
on Black Head&rsquo;s impregnable stronghold.
There, too, were the daring ones, the boy and
the wildly dancing girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; she whispered tensely once
more. &ldquo;She is gone. The waves have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more she was mistaken. With a scream
of triumph the child emerged from the spray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I had never seen them,&rdquo; she mumbled
angrily.</p>
<p>The death of a human being, particularly a
child with all the bright glories of life before
her, is something to give pause to every other
human being in the world.</p>
<p>It did seem an unkind act of Providence that
had thrust these two young people who knew
so little of fear and of the sea into the presence
of one who had experienced so much of the
ocean&rsquo;s wild terrors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>She had seen this boy and girl twice before.
There had been the painful swordfishing episode.
Then once, as she had guided her motor
boat into the tiny harbor at Monhegan, a cry
had struck her ear. She had taken it for a cry
of distress. Surf had been rushing in masses
of gray foam over the shoals before Monhegan.
There had been something of a fog. Having
caught the outlines of a green punt there in
the foam, she had exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have lost their oars. Their boat will
be smashed on the rocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With infinite pains, in danger every moment
of losing her motor boat, she had worked her
way close, then had shouted to them.</p>
<p>To her great disgust, she had seen the boy
turn and laugh. Once again they were using
the ocean as a plaything. Having thrown an
anchor attached to a long painter among the
rocks, they were riding the surf in their shallow
punt.</p>
<p>A strange providence had saved them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now they are at it again,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave this island. I won&rsquo;t be their
keeper. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>She broke off, to stand for ten seconds, staring.
A piercing scream had struck her ear. No
cry of joy, this. As she looked she saw the boy
alone on the slanting rock. On the crest of a
wave she caught a fleck of white that was not
foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl! She&rsquo;s out there! She&rsquo;s swimming.
She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash she shot down the rocky path.
At the same instant an old man, his gray hairs
flying, sprang down the other bank of the
rocky run.</p>
<p>The old man reached the spot before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Not you!&rdquo; she panted. She knew
that no white-haired patriarch could brave
that angry swirl of foam and live.</p>
<p>The aged inventor knew this quite well. He
knew something more. He had measured the
boy&rsquo;s strength and prowess and found it
wanting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you either,&rdquo; he panted as the suddenly
panic-stricken and heart-broken city boy prepared
to leap to the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; The old man seized him and
pinned him to the rock. &ldquo;If someone is to undo
the harm done by your recklessness it must be
another.&rdquo; The aged inventor paused, out of
breath.</p>
<p>That other was Ruth. No one knew that
better than she. The time had come when she
must battle with death for the life of another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go! Go for a boat!&rdquo; she shouted to the boy
and the man. Her voice carried above the roar
of the surf. With that she leaped square into
the arms of a gigantic wave to be carried
away by it toward the spot where the white
speck, which had a moment before been a joyous
twelve-year-old girl, struggled more feebly
and ever more feebly against the forces that
strove to drag her down.</p>
<p>The battle that followed will always remain
a part of Monhegan&rsquo;s colorful history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Two thoughts stuck in Ruth&rsquo;s mind as,
throwing the foam from her face, she struck
for the place where the white spot had last
been. She must get a firm grip on the girl;
then she must go out, out, OUT. Nothing else
could save them. By a great good fortune this
was a moment of comparative calm. But such
calms are deceiving. Ruth was not to be deceived.
The ocean was a cat playing with a
mouse. At any moment it might be raging
again. To attempt a landing on the rocks, to
allow one&rsquo;s self to be cast high against Black
Head&rsquo;s pitiless wall was to meet death at a
single blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go out, out, OUT. There is life,&rdquo;
she told herself over and over.</p>
<p>But first the girl. A low wave lifted her.
Riding its crest, she caught a glimpse of that
slight figure. But now she was gone, perhaps
forever.</p>
<p>But no; there she was closer now, still battling
feebly against the blind forces dragging
her down.</p>
<p>With almost superhuman strength the fisher
girl leaped against the waves. Now she had
covered half the distance, now two-thirds, and
now she reached the child. As if to torment
her, a wave snatched her away. She disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>But no, there she was, closer now. Her hand
shot out. She grasped a shred of white. It
gave way. A second stroke, and she had her.</p>
<p>Gripping her firmly with one hand, she
swam with the other. Swimming now with all
her might, she made her way out until the sea
grew wild again.</p>
<p>Nothing could be done now but keep heads
above the foam and spray. One, two, three
waves, each one higher than the last, carried
them toward the terrible wall of stone. Now
they were five yards back, now eight, now ten.
With an agonizing cry, the girl saw the rocks
loom above them.</p>
<p>But now, just in the nick of time, as if a hand
had been laid upon the water and a mighty
voice had whispered, &ldquo;Peace! Be still!&rdquo; the
waves receded.</p>
<p>Ruth, looking into the younger girl&rsquo;s eyes,
read understanding there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you cling to my blouse? I can swim
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s answer was a grip at the collar
that could not be broken.</p>
<p>The next moment a fearful onrush found
them farther out, safer. But Ruth&rsquo;s strength
was waning. There was no haven here. A
boat was their only hope.</p>
<p>Hardly had she thought this than a dark
prow cut a wave a hundred yards beyond them.
Above the prow was a sea-tanned face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Field!&rdquo; She shouted aloud with
joy. Captain Field is the youngest, bravest
of all the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will be saved,&rdquo; she said, huskily.
The girl&rsquo;s grip on her jacket tightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>The rescue of two girls by a small fishing
schooner tossed by such a sea was no easy
task. More than once it seemed the boat would
be swamped and all lost. Three times the
waves snatched them away as they were upon
the point of being drawn aboard. But in the
end, steady nerves, strong muscles and brave
hearts won. Dripping, exhausted, but triumphant,
Ruth and the one she had saved were
lifted over the gunwale. At once the staunch
little motor boat began its journey to a safe
harbor, and all the comforts of home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />THE TILTING FLOOR</h2>
<p>That evening Ruth sat before a tiny open
grate in her room at Field&rsquo;s cabin. She was
alone; wanted to be. The summer folks were
giving a concert up at the big hotel. Pearl and
Don had gone. She had wanted to sit and
think.</p>
<p>She had been angry for hours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave
Monhegan in the morning,&rdquo; she told herself,
rising to stamp back and forth across the narrow
room. &ldquo;If Don isn&rsquo;t ready to go, I&rsquo;ll take
the tug to Booth Harbor and go down by
steamer. I won&rsquo;t stay here, not another day!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>She slumped down in her chair again to
stare moodily at the fire. What had angered
her? This she herself could not very clearly
have told. Perhaps it was because they had
tried to make a heroine of her. She hadn&rsquo;t
meant to be a heroine, wouldn&rsquo;t be made one.
The whole population of the island, a hundred
and fifty or more, had flocked down to the dock
when Captain Field brought her and the rescued
girl in.</p>
<p>There had been shouts of &ldquo;What a wonder!
A miracle girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An artist had wanted her to pose for a portrait.
&ldquo;So romantically rugged,&rdquo; he had said
as he gripped her arm with fingers that were
soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romantically rugged.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t want
her portrait painted; had only wanted dry
clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had no right to do it,&rdquo; she told herself
savagely. &ldquo;If that boy and girl hadn&rsquo;t been
tempting God and Providence by playing in
the surf, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been obliged to risk
my life to save the girl. And on top of that
they have the nerve to want me to pose as a
heroine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>She slumped lower in her chair. Yes, she&rsquo;d
go home to-morrow. She had begun by loving
Monhegan. The bold, stark beauty of it had
fascinated her. Nowhere else did the surf run
so high. Nowhere else were the headlands so
bold. No surf was so green, blue and purple
as that which rose and fell off Black Head,
Burnt Head and Skull Rock.</p>
<p>But now the cold brutality of nature as demonstrated
here left her terrified and cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, she was only in a physical
slump after a heroic effort. For all that, she
had formed a resolve to leave Monhegan in the
morning. Like a spike in a mahogany log, the
resolve had struck home. It would not be
withdrawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>As for Pearl, she was at that moment listening
to such music as it was seldom her privilege
to hear&mdash;Tittle&rsquo;s Serenade done on harp,
flute, violin and cello. Her eyes were half
closed, but for all that she was seeing things.
She was, as in a vision, looking into the night
where a single ray of light fell upon a mysterious
dark-winged seaplane speeding away
through the fog above the sea.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was at noon of that day that Betty found
herself moving slowly, cautiously down the
narrow passageway at the heart of old Fort
Skammel, that was supposed to lead to the
spot where Ruth had seen the face in the light
of her Roman candle on the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>The place was spooky enough in daytime.
In truth, day and night were alike in those
subterranean passageways which had once led
from dungeon to dungeon and from a battery
room to one at a farther corner of the massive
pile of masonry. No ray of light ever entered
there. The walls were damp and clammy as
a tomb.</p>
<p>Still, urged on by mystery and who knows
what need of change and excitement, the slender,
dark-eyed girl pushed forward down this
corridor, round a curve, across a small room
which echoed in a hollow way at her every
footstep, then round a curve again until with
a wildly beating heart she paused on the very
spot where Ruth had fired the eventful Roman
candle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Nor was she to wait long for a thrill. Of a
sudden, of all places in that dark, damp and
chill passage, a hot breath of air struck her
cheek.</p>
<p>Her face blanched as she sprang backward.
It was as if a fiery dragon, inhabiting this forsaken
place, had breathed his hot breath upon
her.</p>
<p>Be it said to her credit that, after that one
step backward, she held her ground. Lifting
a trembling hand, she shot the light of her electric
torch before her.</p>
<p>That which met her gaze brought an exclamation
to her lips. Not ten feet before her
a square in the floor, some three feet across,
tilted upward. Moved by an invisible, silent
force, it tilted more and more. A crack had
appeared between the floor and the tilting slab.
From this crack came the blast of heat that
fanned her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fort is on fire,&rdquo; she told herself in a
moment of wild terror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Then, in spite of her fright, she laughed.
How could a structure built entirely of stone
burn? The thing was absurd; yet there was
the heat from that subterranean cavity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; She caught her breath again. The
heat waves had been cut short off. She looked.
The slab of stone was dropping silently down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why it&rsquo;s as if someone lifted it to have
a look at me!&rdquo; she told herself as a fresh tremor
shot up her spine.</p>
<p>She did not doubt for a moment that this
conclusion was correct. In spite of this, and
in defiance of her trembling limbs that threatened
to collapse, she moved forward until she
stood upon the very slab that had been lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem different from the others,&rdquo; she
told herself. &ldquo;Nothing to mark it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she told herself as her eager feet
carried her farther and farther from that
haunting spot, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done a little exploring.
I&rsquo;ve made a discovery and had a thrill. That&rsquo;s
quite enough for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to tell someone,&rdquo; she mused as she
sat before the wood fire in the great fireplace
of the big summer cottage on the hill that evening.
&ldquo;But then, I wonder if I should? It&rsquo;s
really Ruth&rsquo;s mystery. She should have a
share in its uncovering. I&rsquo;ll go back to-morrow
and see what more I can discover,&rdquo; she
told herself at last.</p>
<p>Had she but known it, reinforcements were
shortly to be on the way. In Don&rsquo;s room on
Monhegan, Ruth, Pearl and Don had just held
a consultation. In the end they agreed that
they should start for home in the morning.</p>
<p>A short while after this, Ruth, as she was
about to fall asleep, reached a comforting conclusion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I saved that girl&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;it should square that swordfish affair. I
can now spend the swordfish money with a
good conscience. I shall have a new punt as
soon as I reach Portland Harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Don&rsquo;s boat was a sailing sloop with a
&ldquo;kicker&rdquo; (a small gasoline motor) to give him
a lift when the wind was against him. The
day they started for home was unusually calm.
Sails bagged and flapped in the gentle breeze.
The little motor pop-popped away, doing its
best, but they made little progress until toward
night, when a brisk breeze came up from the
east. Then, setting all sail, and shutting off
the motor, they bent to the wind and went
gliding along before it.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like a seaworthy sail
boat, a fair wind and a gently rippling sea. At
night, with the sea all black about you and the
stars glimmering above, you appear to drift
through a faultless sky toward worlds unknown.</p>
<p>Ruth and Pearl, after their exciting experiences
on Monhegan, enjoyed this to the full.
Not for long, however, for there was something
in the salt sea air and the gently rocking
boat which suggested long hours of sleep. So,
after wrapping themselves in blankets, with a
spare sail for a mattress, they stretched out
upon the deck and were soon lost to the world
of reality and at home in the land of dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>It was on this same calm day that Betty returned
to old Fort Skammel and the scene of
the tilting stone floor.</p>
<p>Just what she expected to see or do, she
could not perhaps have told. Driven on by the
spirit of adventure, and beckoned forward by
the lure of mystery, she just went, that was
all.</p>
<p>As it turned out, she saw that which gave
her food for thought during many a long hour.</p>
<p>Having made her way, with hesitating steps
and backward glances, to the spot where Ruth
had seen the face-in-the-fire, she threw her
light ahead; then, with a quick little &ldquo;Oh-oo&rdquo;
took an involuntary step backward.</p>
<p>The square section of stone floor was now
tilted to a rakish angle. It appeared stationary.
Beneath it was revealed an open space
some three feet across.</p>
<p>As the girl switched off her light and stood
there trembling, she realized that a faint unearthly
yellow light shone from the half dark
space beneath the stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>For a full moment, with no sound save the
wild beating of her heart to disturb the silence
of the place, she stood there motionless.</p>
<p>Then, seeing that nothing happened, she
plucked up courage, and, without turning on
her torch, dropped on hands and knees, to
creep toward the oblong of yellow light.</p>
<p>Three times her heart leaped into her mouth.
A small stone rolling from beneath her hand
wakened low echoes in the place. A stone that
gave way beneath her suggested that she
might at any moment be plunged into an unknown
abyss below. Some sound in the distance,
probably made by a rat, all but made her
flee. In time she found herself gazing down
into the space beneath the tilted floor.</p>
<p>The sight that met her gaze was worthy of
her effort. A small square room lay beneath
her and in that room, revealed by the witch-like
yellow light, piled on every side and in
great squares at the center, were bolts and
bolts of richly colored silks and boxes beyond
number, all filled, if one were to be guided by
the three that had been broken open, with silk
dresses, red, blue, orange, green, silver and
gold, fit for any princess of old.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; she said under her breath.</p>
<p>Then, just as she was beginning to wonder
and to plan, there sounded far down some dark
corridor heavy footsteps.</p>
<p>In wild consternation, without again switching
on her torch, she sprang away down the
narrow passageway. Nor did she draw an
easy breath until she was in her punt and half
way across the bay.</p>
<p>Then as she dropped the oars for a second
she drank in three long breaths of air to at
last release a long drawn &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not been in the big summer cottage
on the hill five minutes, her brain pulsating
from a desire to tell someone of her marvelous
discovery, when the rich lady of the house told
her of a yachting party to start early next
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be gone three or four days,&rdquo; she
was told. &ldquo;Pack your bag well, and don&rsquo;t forget
your bathing suit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three days! Oh&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; She came very
near letting the cat out of the bag right there,
but caught herself just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! Don&rsquo;t you want to go?&rdquo; Her benefactress
stared at her in astonishment. &ldquo;It will
be a most marvelous trip, all the way to Booth
Bay and perhaps Monhegan, and on Sir
Thomas Wright&rsquo;s eighty-foot yacht. You
never saw such a boat, Betty. Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;d love to go.&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s tone was
quite cheerful and sincere now. She had
caught that magic name Monhegan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth and Pearl are up there,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small island. I am sure to see
them. I&rsquo;ll tell Ruth. It&rsquo;s her secret. Then,
when we come back&mdash;&rdquo; She closed her eyes
and saw again those piles and piles of shimmering
silken dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try them on, every one,&rdquo; she told
herself with a little gurgle of delight that set
the others in the room staring at her.</p>
<p>But Ruth and Pearl, as you already know,
were on their way home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />THE WAVERING RED LIGHT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Don. What a strange red light.&rdquo;
Pearl, who had been curled like a kitten on
the prow of the boat, rose on her elbows to
point away to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Don asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over by Witches Cove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of lights on the sea,&rdquo; he grumbled.
He was tightening the last bolts in the pride
of his life, his sloop with a kicker, which he
had whimsically named <i>Foolemagin</i>. They had
been home from Monhegan a full day now.
His motor had gone wrong, and he was repairing
it. In a few moments she would be
cutting the waters down the bay. He did not
wish to be disturbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this one acts so strangely,&rdquo; Pearl persisted.
&ldquo;It sort of wavers up and down, like&mdash;like
a ship in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Distress! What nonsense!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed
impatiently as he tossed down a hammer
and seized a wrench. &ldquo;There is no sea tonight.
A little swell, that&rsquo;s all. How could a
ship go aground on a night like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now!&rdquo; he sighed at last. &ldquo;She ought
to do for a trial trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Releasing his boat from the float to which
she was anchored, he threw the motor into
gear. Purring as sweetly as a cat on the
hearth, the motor set the boat gliding through
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be finer?&rdquo; He dropped back
on the circular seat in the stern.</p>
<p>Indeed, what could? The sea, the night and
a boat. Such a boat, too! True, the hull of the
<i>Foolemagin</i> had seen much service. But it was
strongly built, and Don Bracket knew his business.
He had calked her well. And her motor
was nearly new. Little wonder that the boy&rsquo;s
heart swelled with joy and pride as the boat,
responding to the lightest touch, headed for
the open sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>The boy had worked hard and long for this
prize. In a twelve-foot punt he had rowed hundreds
of miles. Setting lobster pots, trapping
crabs, digging clams for the summer folks, he
had added a dime here, a quarter there, a dollar
now and then until there was enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;since Monhegan disappointed
me, I&rsquo;ll get busy here at home. I&rsquo;ll
make a lot more lobster pots. I&rsquo;ll set them
out by Green Island, Witches Cove and the
Hue and Cry. I&rsquo;ll get big ones, five pounders,
beauties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his dreaming he quite forgot the girl who
still lay half curled up back of the prow. To
one who did not know her, Pearl might have
seemed a kitten sort of girl, soft, dreamy and
purring. Not so Don. He knew she could
swim as strong and far as he, that she could
row a punt or drag a lobster pot from the
shoals with the best of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>She could relax it is true. Everyone should
be able to do that. She was relaxed now, staring
dreamy eyed into the gathering darkness.
But of a sudden she sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Don!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Look at the wavering
red light. Over by Witches Cove.&rdquo; They
were much nearer now. &ldquo;It is someone in distress.
Must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without reply, Don turned the prow of his
boat toward the shoals back of Witches Cove,
set his motors doing their best, then leaned
back to watch with half closed eyes that wavering
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lights,&rdquo; said the girl, as if half talking to
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of lights about the bay
these days&mdash;too many,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Mysterious
doings, I&rsquo;d say. That fellow in the
cabin by Witches Cove knows something about
it all, I&rsquo;ll be bound. He may have something
to do with this light, decoy or something. But
I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kept his boat headed squarely for the
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>The girl did not answer his remarks. They
had set her thinking all the same. There had
been strange doings about the bay. And not
the least mysterious person who might be connected
with them was the man who had taken
up his abode in the abandoned cabin among the
black clump of firs that cast their dark shadows
over Witches Cove.</p>
<p>Many and strange were the thoughts that
passed through her mind as they came closer
and closer to that dark sea cove about which
weird and fantastic tales had been woven.</p>
<p>There were persons who could not be induced
to fish there; no, not even at midday,
and now it was night.</p>
<p>For this girl whose home had always been
on Peak&rsquo;s Island, this cove had always held a
charmed fascination. As a small child, listening
to the tales of gray witches that rose from
its depths in the dark of the moon, she had time
and again begged to be taken there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>As soon as she was old enough to row a
punt this far, she had fairly haunted the spot
on Saturdays and holidays. The banks of
this pool were steep and rocky. There were
spots where its depths even at low tide exceeded
twenty feet. There were times when
the waters were as dark and green as old jade.
At such times the movement of the incoming
tide seemed caused by some monster disturbed
in his slumbers at the pool&rsquo;s bottom, and the
rush of water among the rocks seemed a whispering
voice. The very fish she caught there
were different. As if touched by the brush
of a great artist, they took on fantastic colors&mdash;red,
deep blue, purple and green. The
girl loved the spot. She thrilled now as she
neared it.</p>
<p>It had been on one of her Saturday afternoon
fishing trips, not two weeks back, as you
may remember, that she had first discovered
that someone had taken up his abode on this
small rocky and hitherto uninhabited island.</p>
<p>She fell to thinking now of the two great
cats and the little man with the wide-rimmed
glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There! Right back there!&rdquo; she said suddenly
as the light, swinging clear of the sea,
continued to waver backward and forward in
a jerky and uncertain manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the boy answered. &ldquo;Be there in
a minute. It may be some false alarm. Be
ready for a sudden start if I need to make it.
If it&rsquo;s smugglers or booze runners we may have
to run for it. They don&rsquo;t love company too
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing they saw as they rounded the
reef and stood close in, astonished them much.
Lying on her side, with a gash in her side, was
a one time smartly rigged sailboat. Holding to
the mast, and waving a lantern around which
was wound a red cloth, was a boy a year or
two younger than Don. Clinging to him for
support as the heavy swell lifted and lowered
the wreck was a mere slip of a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a day past twelve,&rdquo; was Pearl&rsquo;s mental
comment.</p>
<p>In an instant she recognized them. Yet she
could not believe her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, more to
herself than to Don. &ldquo;But it is! It&rsquo;s the girl
Ruth saved from the surf at Monhegan, and
her brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strangest part of all was that the girl
at this moment showed no sign of terror. Her
black eyes danced, as much as to say, &ldquo;Well,
here is a real lark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo; Don asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monhegan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monhegan!&rdquo; Don gasped. A girl and a boy
in a sailboat coming fifty miles over an open
sea. The thing seemed incredible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to come so far,&rdquo; said the
boy. &ldquo;Went out for a little lark. Didn&rsquo;t know
much about this boat. Uncle gave her to me
a week ago. She got going and I couldn&rsquo;t head
her in, so we just came on down. Some joke,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don didn&rsquo;t see any joke in it. A fine boat
wrecked and all that, but he had to admit that
affairs do not look the same to all people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take us ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But this boat of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her bust up. Don&rsquo;t care much for sailing.
Dad&rsquo;s getting me a motor launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; Don stared incredulous.
True, the sailboat was an old model. For all
that, she had been a fast one in her day, and
could easily be made seaworthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cost thousands,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don! Don!&rdquo; Pearl was tugging at his arm,
whispering excitedly in his ear. &ldquo;Ask them to
let us have it. We can fix it up. I want it for
my very own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So excited was she that her whisper came
near to being a low scream. The strange boy
heard, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can save her, she&rsquo;s yours,&rdquo; he promised.
&ldquo;Only get us out of this. We&rsquo;re wet and
getting cold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>To Don the thing that the other boy proposed&mdash;that
the boat, any boat for that matter,
should be left to pound its heart out like
a robin beating its breast against a cage,
seemed a crime little short of murder. To a
boy whose ancestors for generations have belonged
on the sea, a ship is a living thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you over,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Get
in. Quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further word, the boy and girl
climbed aboard.</p>
<p>By great good fortune Ruth was at the dock
when they came in. To her was entrusted the
task of conducting the boy and girl to warm
quarters where they might find a change of
clothing.</p>
<p>In Ruth&rsquo;s cottage the boy and girl sat beside
the fisher girl in silence, dreamily watching the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said Ruth, breaking
the silence, &ldquo;that your sister&rsquo;s very narrow
escape from drowning made no impression
upon you, that you are as willing as ever to
gamble with your life?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t drown, did she?&rdquo; the boy looked
at her and laughed. &ldquo;She had luck. Her time
hadn&rsquo;t come, that&rsquo;s all. No use making a
fuss about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; Ruth said quietly, &ldquo;is a precious possession.
No one has a right to think of it
lightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; said the boy with a toss of the head,
&ldquo;is a joke. We&rsquo;re here because we&rsquo;re here and
because we are to have a good time. What&rsquo;s
the use of making a fuss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth looked at him but said no more.</p>
<p>In her own room an hour later she sat looking
off at the bay. Her thoughts were sadly
mixed. She felt that the plan of life that had
always been hers was slipping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much work, friends, a home and a little
pleasure now and then, holidays, and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Life,&rsquo;&rdquo; she quoted thoughtfully, &ldquo;&lsquo;is a
joke. Life is a joke. What&rsquo;s the use of making
a fuss?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>She took down a box from a what-not in the
corner. There was money in the box, the last
of the swordfish money. She had bought a
punt because it was truly needed. She had
meant to spend the remainder for useful things
about the house and for fishing tackle which
was also very practical.</p>
<p>But now, &ldquo;Life is a joke.&rdquo; She allowed the
coins to slip through her fingers like grains of
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A figured taffeta dress,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always wanted one, and a new hat, and new
pumps. I&rsquo;ll have them, too. Life is a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she truly convinced herself that it was
not worth while to look upon the business of
living as a serious matter? Who can say? Perhaps
she did not know herself.</p>
<p>As for Don and Pearl, they hurried back
and were soon busily engaged in the business
of preparing to salvage the wreck.</p>
<p>To Pearl, who kept repeating to herself, &ldquo;If
we can only do it. If only we can!&rdquo; the moments
consumed by Don in rolling barrels and
carrying chains to the sloop seemed endless.
But at last with the meager deck of the <i>Foolemagin</i>
piled high, they headed once more for
Witches Cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>The cove, as they neared it this time, seemed
more fearsome and ghostly than ever before.
The moon was under a cloud. The clump of
firs hung like a menacing thing over the cliff.
The light from the mysterious stranger&rsquo;s cabin
was gone. Pearl shuddered as she caught the
long drawn wail of a prowling cat.</p>
<p>She shook herself free from these fancies.
There was work to be done. Would they succeed?
She prayed that they might. The tide
was still rising. That would help. The empty
barrels, once they were sunk beneath the surface
and chained to the broken hull, would help
to buoy the sailboat up.</p>
<p>With practiced hand Don began the task
that lay before him. Pearl helped when she
could.</p>
<p>The first gray streaks of dawn were showing
across the water when, with a little sigh
of satisfaction, Don beached the disabled boat
on their own sandy shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With a line from shore,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
be safe here until noonday tide. Then I&rsquo;ll get
her drawn up high and dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearl did not reply. Curled up in the prow
of his motor boat, she had fallen fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave girl,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;If we can make
that boat tight and seaworthy she shall be all
your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock of a moonless, starlit night
Pearl lay on the deck of the boat, her own first
sailing boat. The work of repair was done.
The <i>Flyaway</i>, as they had rechristened her, had
gone on her maiden trip &rsquo;round the island and
down the bay. She had proven herself a thing
of unspeakable joy. Speed, quick to pick up,
with a keel of lead that held her steady in a
heavy blow, responsive to the lightest touch
on rudder or sail, she was all that mind might
ask or heart desire.</p>
<p>Already Pearl loved her as she might a
flesh and blood companion. To lie on her deck
here beneath the stars was like resting in the
arms of her mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Three hours before, Ruth had rowed Pearl
out in her new punt. Then, because there was
work to do ashore, she had rowed back again.</p>
<p>One &ldquo;Whoo-o! Whoo-o!&rdquo; through cupped
lips and she would come for her.</p>
<p>The night was still. Scarcely a vessel was
stirring on the bay. Only once, a half hour or
so before, she had caught the creak of oars.
She had not so much as risen on elbow to see
what boat it might be. Had she done so, she
would have experienced a shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting late,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;Have to
go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising on her knees, she cupped her hands to
utter the old familiar call, &ldquo;Whoo-oo-ee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A call came echoing back. She listened for
the sound of Ruth&rsquo;s shoving off. Instead she
caught low exclamations of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pearl,&rdquo; came in troubled tones, &ldquo;the
punt&rsquo;s gone! Did you see anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl was on her feet, fumbling
the sail. &ldquo;But I heard them. They were
headed for Portland Harbor. They must have
stolen it. Quick! Get some boat and come
out. There&rsquo;s a stiff breeze. We&rsquo;ll catch them
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; Ruth went racing down the beach.</p>
<p>For a girl Pearl displayed an astonishing
amount of skill with sail and rigging. Before
Ruth in a borrowed dory bumped alongside
she had the sail up and was winding away at
the anchor rope. A minute more and they were
gliding silently through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like a sailboat for following a
thief,&rdquo; Ruth whispered. &ldquo;Silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a sound. Slip right onto them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope we can!&rdquo; The older girl&rsquo;s work-hardened
fingers gripped a long oar. If they overhauled
the thief there&rsquo;d be no tardy justice.
He&rsquo;d get it good and plenty right on the side
of the head. It was the way of the bay. They
were heartless wretches, these Portland wharf
rats. On the sea boat stealing is bad as horse
stealing on land. Yet if one of these men
missed the last ferry he took the first rowboat
he came upon, rowed across the bay, then cut
her adrift. The owner was not likely to see
his boat again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>As the water glided beneath them and the
semi-darkness advanced to swallow them up,
Ruth kept an eye out for a light or a movement
upon the water. Twice she thought they were
upon them. Each time, with an intake of
breath, she gave Pearl whispered instructions
and the boat swerved in its course. Each time
they were disappointed. A floating barrel, a
clump of eel grass had deceived them.</p>
<p>And now they were nearing a vast bulk that
loomed dark and menacing before them. Old
Fort Georges, built of stone before the Civil
War, now abandoned save as a storeroom and
warehouse, lay directly in their path.</p>
<p>This fort, that was said by some to be a
storing place for enough army explosives to
blow the whole group of islands out to sea, had
always cast a spell of gloom and half terror
over the girl at the helm. She was glad enough
when Ruth told her to swing over to the right
and give it a wide berth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>The fort is built on a reef. To pass it one
must allow for the reef. Pearl, who knew these
waters as well as any man, was swinging far
out when her cousin whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! Swing her in a bit. I heard a sound
over there. Like something heavy being dropped
into a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Pearl obeyed her heart was in her mouth.
Eerie business, this skulking about an abandoned
fort at midnight.</p>
<p>What followed will always remain a mass
of confused memories in Pearl&rsquo;s mind. As the
boat glided along, something appeared before
them. With a suddenness that was startling,
Ruth cut down the sail, then seized the rudder.
Even so they missed the other boat, Ruth&rsquo;s
punt, by a very narrow margin.</p>
<p>They shot by, but not before Ruth, jumping
clear of the sailboat, landed in the punt.</p>
<p>As she gripped at her breast to still her
heart&rsquo;s mad beating, Pearl caught sounds of
blows, then cries for mercy, followed by muttered
words of warning. There came a splash,
then another. Then save for the labored pant
of someone swimming, all was still.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>At once wild questions took possession of
Pearl. What if her cousin had been thrown
overboard? Here she was with sail down, a
girl, defenseless.</p>
<p>Gripping the rope, she hauled madly at the
sail. It went up with a sudden start, then
stuck. She threw her whole weight upon it.
It gave way suddenly, to drop her sprawling
upon the deck. She lost her hold. The sail
came down with a bang.</p>
<p>She was in the midst of her third frantic attempt
to get under way, to go for help, when
a voice quite near her said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Let the sail go. I&rsquo;ll hoist
it. Catch this painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth!&rdquo; Pearl&rsquo;s tone voiced her joy.</p>
<p>A rope struck across the deck. She caught
it. The next moment her cousin was climbing
on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> my punt,&rdquo; said Ruth quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men? What did they do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Went overboard, and swam for the fort.
Let &rsquo;em shiver there till morning. Do &rsquo;em
good. Teach &rsquo;em a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something queer, though,&rdquo; she said as she
made the painter fast. &ldquo;They seemed terribly
afraid I&rsquo;d beat up their cargo. Must be fresh
eggs. Let&rsquo;s have a flashlight. We&rsquo;ll take a
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A circle of light fell across the punt. A long
drawn breath of excitement escaped the girl&rsquo;s
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder they were in a hurry to get
away!&rdquo; There was genuine alarm in her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What is it?&rdquo; Pearl gripped her
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamite,&rdquo; Ruth answered soberly.
&ldquo;Enough to blow us all to Glory sixteen times.
And if I had struck a stick of it squarely with
my oar&mdash;&rdquo; Again she let out a long low sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;Next
thing is something else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>There really was only one thing to be done;
that was to take the dynamite to the office of
the Coast Guard in Portland and to tell the
officer all there was to tell about it. This they
did on the next morning. When this was done
they considered the matter closed. It was not,
however, not by a long mile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />THE LITTLE MAN OF WITCHES COVE</h2>
<p>That day, after Ruth had delivered her fear-inspiring
cargo, which had doubtless been
stolen from Fort Georges, to the proper authorities,
she went uptown to shop. There she selected
with care a figured taffeta dress, a
bright new hat and new shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t show them to anyone until Sunday,&rdquo;
she told herself. When an uneasy feeling took
possession of her she stilled it by whispering,
&ldquo;Life is a joke.&rdquo; Had she been asked quite
suddenly what that had to do with a figured
taffeta dress, she might not, perhaps, have been
able to tell.</p>
<p>That same day, Pearl took her new dory
and rowed away to her favorite fishing ground,
Witches Cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>She had not been fishing long when she
caught sight of the mysterious little man who,
with his two great black cats, had come to live
in the abandoned cottage above the cove.</p>
<p>At first he was seated on a tall rock, studying
the sea with a great brass telescope. Presently,
however, she saw that he had left the
rock and was making his way down the fern
grown rocks near her. As he came, she studied
him out of one corner of her eye. She lost
two perfectly good cunners doing this, but it
was worth the price. This man was peculiar,
a &ldquo;new type,&rdquo; one of Pearl&rsquo;s learned friends
would have called him. He was short almost
to deformity. He was bow-legged and very
broad shouldered. He wore dark glasses which
completely hid his eyes. Pearl thought nothing
of this last. Many persons living by the ocean
wear such glasses to protect their eyes from the
dazzling reflection that comes from the mirror-like
surface of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, little girl,&rdquo; he said quietly as he settled
himself on a rock overhanging the sea.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the fishing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Pearl resented being called little, though indeed
she was small for sixteen. She was a
little frightened too. Witches Cove is a lonely
spot, and as we have said before, quite spooky
with all its black and green reflections and its
constant murmuring that seems to come from
nowhere.</p>
<p>But she had come to fish. Between the man
and her boat were twenty feet of deep water.
Besides, the man intrigued her. So she stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fishing is fine,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often think I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence. Pearl had
caught sight of a great cunner down there
among the waving kelp. She was tempting
him with a delicious bit of soft clam.</p>
<p>Up went her line, down again, away to one
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O-o! He got it!&rdquo; she murmured, drawing
in her line. With a deft hand she replaced her
bait with a bit of tougher clam meat. Thirty
seconds later a three-pounder was beating a
tattoo in the bottom of her boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good one,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;Can
you now afford a moment for talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be worth your while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; The girl settled back.</p>
<p>The man began to speak. In the twenty
minutes that followed, this mystery man of the
rocky isle told the girl things she had never
dreamed of. He had opened up for her a
new and quite terrible world. He ended by
startling her with his knowledge of recent
events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone stole your cousin&rsquo;s punt,&rdquo; he said
quite suddenly, tilting on his tiptoes above the
black waters.</p>
<p>Pearl looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;Last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was loaded with explosives when you got
it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl stared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for those men. They&rsquo;re dangerous.
We&rsquo;ve nearly got them three times. They
escaped us. Can&rsquo;t find out where they stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearl thought of the face-in-the-fire, and old
Fort Skammel. Her heart gave a great bounce,
but she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know such things?&rdquo; she asked
after a moment.</p>
<p>He leaned far forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something,
but you must not repeat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;m a Secret Service man.&rdquo; Her
heart bounced again. She had read books about
such men, and they were thrilling and scarey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell. And I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
help if I can. It&rsquo;s my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit. Come to me anytime you
have a thing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fish took her bait. She pulled him in.
When she looked up, the man was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Late that evening Betty returned from her
yachting party. She had had a glorious time,
had traveled aboard the most marvelous yacht,
all shining brass and mahogany, satin cushions
and lace curtains. She had had as her traveling
companions such notable people as she
had never hoped to know. A senator, a great
yachtsman, a wonderful actress and a real poet
had been in the party. For all this she found
herself over and over longing to be back at
the island where she might confide her marvelous
secret to those who had a right to know.</p>
<p>They ran over to Monhegan. When she
found that Ruth and Pearl were gone, her desire
to be back increased tenfold.</p>
<p>Hardly had she raced up to the big cottage
on the hill to change from middy and short
blue skirt to blouse and knickers than she went
tearing at a perilous rate down the hill toward
Ruth&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>By great good fortune both Ruth and Pearl
were there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed in an excited
whisper. &ldquo;I have a most beautiful secret!
There&rsquo;s a hole in the floor and it&rsquo;s all full of
the most marvelous silk things!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hole in the floor!&rdquo; said Ruth, quite mystified
by the girl&rsquo;s wild rambling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down to the beach.&rdquo; Betty dragged
at their arms. &ldquo;No one will hear us there. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell you all about it. Oh, girls! We must
do something about it! We truly must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away to the beach they went. There on the
golden sand with the dark waters murmuring
at their feet, with the lights of Portland Harbor
winking and blinking at them, and the
moon looking down upon them like some benevolent
old grandfather, the two girls listened
while Betty unfolded the story of her two visits
to old Fort Skammel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warm room,&rdquo; she said at the end in a
voice that was husky with excitement, &ldquo;a
warm room, all glowing with a weird yellow
light, and full of silk things, dresses and
dresses, all pink and gold, and blue and green.
You never saw any like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go over there,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;but not
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at night.&rdquo; Betty shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When we have all seen it, we&rsquo;ll tell someone,
perhaps Captain O&rsquo;Connor. Can&rsquo;t go to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; Ruth said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
promised to go over and lift Don&rsquo;s lobster
traps. Might get back in time to go over in
the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they left the beach with the Portland
lights still winking and blinking at them, to
return home and to their beds.</p>
<p>As Ruth lay once more in her own bed looking
out on the harbor, she caught the slow
movement of some great dark bulk, and knew
it was the ancient sailing ship, <i>Black Gull</i>.
Never before had this ship spoken so clearly of
the glorious past of dear old Maine, of ships
and the sea, of settlement and glorious conquest,
and of her brave sons who in every generation
had given their lives for freedom.</p>
<p>Never before had she so longed to see the
old ship, with every patched and time-browned
sail set, go gliding out into the free and open
sea. Perhaps this longing was prophetic of
that which was shortly to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />UNDER FIRE</h2>
<p>It was another day, another golden link in
the wondrous chain that is life. Both Ruth and
Betty were some distance away from their
island home, from cottage and big summer
house. Fort Skammel, with its haunting mysteries,
and Witches Cove were far away in the
dreamy distance and well nigh forgotten in the
charm of rocks, sky, sea and summer fragrance
that was all about them. They had come on a
little journey all their own, these two, and for
a purpose. At the present moment Ruth was
seated upon a rocky ledge completely surrounded
by wild sweet peas in full bloom and
Betty was somewhere out to sea in a punt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Green Island, the rugged bit of broken waste
on which Ruth sat, is the home of the seagulls.
No one has ever lived on that island, but, as
evening falls on Casco Bay, many a seagull,
weary with his day&rsquo;s search for food, may be
seen winging his way across the dark waters
to this, his haven of rest.</p>
<p>Of all the spots near Portland Harbor, the
rugged shoals off Green Island are best for
lobster fishing. Don had set a number of
traps here. Having been called to Portland,
he had asked Ruth to sail the <i>Foolemagin</i> out to
the island to lift the traps and bring in the
catch.</p>
<p>She had asked Betty to go with her. Betty
had brought clams and a cod line. There is no
better cod fishing to be had than on the shoals
by Green Island.</p>
<p>Betty had asked permission to fish over the
shoals from Ruth&rsquo;s punt. Since the day was
calm, Ruth had given consent. Such a thing
is always risky, for a sudden fog or a squall
may come up at any moment. But perhaps
Ruth still held in the back of her head the city
boy&rsquo;s declaration, &ldquo;Life is a joke.&rdquo; At any rate,
Betty had gone. The weather had continued
calm and clear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Looking out to sea, Ruth&rsquo;s eye caught the
gleam of Betty&rsquo;s slender white figure standing
up in her punt, fishing. For a time she thought
of Betty and almost envied her. She had seen
so much of the world and of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some people are lucky,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;No use disliking them for their luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, forgetting Betty, she sank back
upon a bed of fragrant wild sweet peas, to stare
dreamily at the drifting white clouds. Then,
without really intending to, she fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>She was startled from her sleep a half hour
later by a resounding boom that shook the
rugged island to its base and set a thousand
seagulls soaring and screaming as only seagulls
can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Target practice,&rdquo; she told herself, in no
great alarm. &ldquo;Ten-mile guns. Oh, listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Came a loud scream as a shell passed at
terrific speed through the air, and again a
deafening boom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Closer to the island than usual,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;Glad I&rsquo;ve lifted the lobster traps.
Guess I&rsquo;ll get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was standing now, looking down at her
staunch little motor boat that gently bumped
the rocky shore of a sheltering cove.</p>
<p>A sudden thought struck her all of a heap.
She came to earth with a jolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Betty Bronson! She
doesn&rsquo;t know about the guns. She can&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;ll
be killed, blown to bits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fort McKinley is ten miles from Green
Island. At certain times of the year a target
is set on a raft and a schooner detailed to drag
it about. When the target is in position near
Green Island, a plane circling low over the
water warns fishing crafts away. Then the
great guns of the fort, firing projectiles weighing
a thousand pounds and more, break their
long silence. Ten miles from the fort, close
to the drifting target, the huge projectile falls.
It strikes the water with a loud report. It
bounces, rises once more in air and, singing its
song of hate and defiance, flies through the air
to at last sink to the bottom a hundred fathoms
below. Into this target practice Betty had
blundered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could warn her,&rdquo; Ruth told herself
now. &ldquo;The man in the seaplane should do it.
But he probably does not see her at all. Little
dark boat against a broad expanse of dark
sea. How could he? And besides, perhaps
there is no danger after all. The firing for to-day
may stop any minute. The target ship
may move off in some other direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The firing did not cease. The target ship
did not move away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to be getting back home.&rdquo; Ruth&rsquo;s
gaze swept a hazy sky, then fell to her staunch
little sloop. &ldquo;Going to storm. Can&rsquo;t tell how
bad. Hate to spend a night out here.&rdquo; But
without Betty she could not go.</p>
<p>Turning, she made her way down the rocky
slope to the spot where her boat was moored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Her hand was on the painter when again,
closer, more terrifying, there came a Zss-Spt-Boom.</p>
<p>Dropping the painter, she turned and walked
hurriedly back up the hill.</p>
<p>With strained attention her eyes sought that
small white figure. It was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Vast relief was expressed in her
tone. &ldquo;Thought she&rsquo;d see how unsafe it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just to make assurance doubly sure, she took
up her field glasses and swept the black waters.</p>
<p>One moment of silent attention and she
dropped the glasses as if they were hot.</p>
<p>The sight that met her gaze as her eager
eyes behind strong field glasses sought out the
lone fisherman, set her heart beating madly.
A shell, striking some distance back of the little
boat, then bouncing in air again, appeared to
pass over the city girl&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>It was then, for the first time that Betty
awoke to her peril. This awakening was like
the sudden ending of a dream. The very abruptness
of it was her undoing. She had just
succeeded in hooking a great fish. Perhaps it
was a thirty-pound cod, a ray or a sunfish. She
will never know, for, having brought it half
way up from the depths, she was shaken to the
very core of her being by this terrific boom and
nerve wracking scream.</p>
<p>She threw herself backward, tangled with
the cod line, set the boat tilting, tried in vain
to recover her balance and without knowing
how it had all happened, suddenly found herself
free of the cod line but submerged in cold
salt water and clinging frantically to the bottom
of her overturned punt.</p>
<p>Ruth, standing on the hill, saw all this. She
saw more; that the girl was still within the
danger zone and that the target schooner was
moving in a direction that momentarily increased
her peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to her,&rdquo; she told herself with a
little gasp of fear. &ldquo;There is no other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>With one short word of prayer for strength,
the fishergirl of the Maine coast dashed down
the slope, jumped into her sloop, threw over
the wheel, then went pop-popping straight
away toward the imperiled girl and her overturned
punt. Straight on into the path of the
raging terror that was intended for enemies
in time of war she went, without one thought
of turning back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; she thought more calmly, &ldquo;is
in my favor. My boat is white. The seaplane
scout may see me. He can signal them to
stop firing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boom! Zing! Boom! the terror sounded
again.</p>
<p>Her heart skipped a beat. Perspiration stood
out on her nose. She felt deathly cold all
over. Yet a firm and steady hand steered the
motor boat straight on its course.</p>
<p>Of a sudden from over her head there came
the thunder of motors. For ten seconds it was
deafening. Then, quite as suddenly as it had
started, it ceased.</p>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s heart stood still. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo; she
thought. The pop-popping of her own tiny
motor seemed but the discharge of a toy pistol.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>She was soon enough to know what was
next. Glancing up, she dodged and barely escaped
leaping into the sea. The great seaplane
seemed about to fall upon her.</p>
<p>The plane, of course, was not as close as it
had seemed. It was so close that, as the motor
suddenly ceased its throbbing, she caught the
singing of struts as the plane went zooming on
through the air. She did not hear distinctly
the words that were shouted down to her, but
she did catch the import of their meaning. It
was a warning that she was in great danger
and must get out of those waters at once. As
an answer she could only shout back that a
girl in an overturned punt was in far greater
danger than she. She pointed in the direction
of Betty and the punt. This pointing must
have accomplished more than all her screams,
for certainly her last words were lost in the
sudden thunder of motors.</p>
<p>The plane was up and off again. Had he
understood? Would he flash a signal that
meant, &ldquo;Cease firing?&rdquo; She dared hope so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Ten seconds later she realized how brave
the sea scout had been. A glancing shell passed
through the air at the very spot where, a few
seconds before, his plane had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is another shot?&rdquo; she thought. She
dared not think further.</p>
<p>But now, once again her eyes were upon the
punt and Betty. Already she was alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Give me your hand!&rdquo; she said in
words that came short and quick. Betty
obeyed. She dropped with a thump in the bottom
of the boat. Then, with all speed, they
were away.</p>
<p>Not until they were safe on Green Island did
they realize that the sea scout had flashed a
message and firing had ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ruth sighed as they dropped in the
sun among the wild sweet peas, &ldquo;we&mdash;we&rsquo;re
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; Betty&rsquo;s face still showed signs
of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They never shoot at the island. But
you&rsquo;ve got to get out of those clothes,&rdquo; Ruth
added quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>In silence she helped Betty out of her sodden
garments. After rubbing and chafing her limbs
until the pink of health came to them, she
wrapped her in her own storm coat and told
her to lie there in the sun while she wrung
her clothes out and spread them on the rocks
to dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;your punt!&rdquo; Betty said at last with
a choke in her voice that came near to a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re firing again now,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;We
may be able to get it and tow it in later. Can&rsquo;t
now. But didn&rsquo;t you hear the guns?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guns? Why, yes, I guess I did. Must
have&mdash;as in a dream. They&rsquo;re always booming
away over at the fort. And I was having such
wonderful luck! Lots of cod, one ten-pounder.
And a polluk long as I am. Just hooked one
so big I couldn&rsquo;t land him when that terrible
thing happened! But Ruth&mdash;do you truly
think we can save your punt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might. I hope so. Current is strong. That
will carry it away. Hope they stop soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Betty dreamily. The shock,
the bright sunshine, the drug-like scent of wild
sweet peas were getting the better of her. Soon,
with head pillowed on her arm, she was fast
asleep.</p>
<p>As she slept Ruth thought of many things,
of the seagulls soaring overhead, of her lost
punt, of the booming, bursting shells, of the old
ship <i>Black Gull</i> and of the strange secret room
in the depths of old Fort Skammel.</p>
<p>The firing ceased without her knowing it.
Betty awoke and struggled into her wind-blown,
sundried garments. Still she sat staring
dreamily at the sea.</p>
<p>Then a sudden burst of sound broke in upon
her day dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plane,&rdquo; she said, springing to her feet.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not flying. He&rsquo;s
scooting along on the surface of the water.
He&rsquo;s towing something. Oh, good!&rdquo; She
leaped into the air to do a wild dance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your punt! It&rsquo;s not lost! He found
it! He&rsquo;s bringing it in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all quite gloriously true. Very
soon the seaplane came to a halt before the
island. The aviator unbuckled himself; then
walked back along the fusilage to drop into
the punt and begin rowing shoreward.</p>
<p>As he came close Ruth saw that he was a
young army officer with a clean, frank face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; he said to Betty. &ldquo;Lucky
to have such a brave friend. You might have
been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s arm stole round Ruth&rsquo;s waist. Ruth&rsquo;s
face took on an unusual rosy tint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought back your punt,&rdquo; he said in
apparent embarrassment. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a long
swim back to my plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll row you out,&rdquo; said Ruth, springing
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you might.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>As the young officer sat in the stern and Ruth
rowed him out to sea he noted with apparent
pleasure the play of the splendid muscles in
her brown arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some seaman,&rdquo; he complimented her.</p>
<p>Again Ruth flushed.</p>
<p>As they swung in beside the seaplane the
girl&rsquo;s eyes took in every detail of the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw one so close before,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to take a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she said as he stood up
in the punt, &ldquo;a friend of mine, my cousin, saw
a plane pass Monhegan in the dead of night.
Trans-Atlantic plane, wouldn&rsquo;t you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Only none have crossed for a long
time. Say!&rdquo; he said, sitting down again. &ldquo;What
sort of a plane was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Large, sea-colored plane. No name. No
insignia. No mark of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer. Listen!&rdquo; He put a hand on
her arm. &ldquo;Keep that dark. You may have
made an important discovery. Men are coming
to this country that we don&rsquo;t want here.
Things have happened. There&rsquo;s more than
one way to get into America these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t make a
great discovery, invent some new thing, do a
daring deed, but those who are selfish, heartless,
who wish to kill, destroy, tear down, take
possession of it! But I must go. Hope I see
you again soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for bringing back the punt,&rdquo; Ruth
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang upon the fusilage. Ruth rowed
away. Motors thundered. The plane glided
away, rose, then speedily became a speck in
the sky.</p>
<p>Ruth bumped the rocky shore with a crash
that nearly overturned the punt. She was
thinking of many things.</p>
<p>They did not go to old Fort Skammel that
evening. It was late when they got back to
their island and Betty&rsquo;s nerves were pretty
well shaken up by the happenings of the day.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />THE PASSING OF BLACK GULL</h2>
<p>That night as the hours of slumber approached
Ruth lay on her bed looking out
toward the bay. The night was hot and sultry.
A lazy warm breeze from the land waved
the thin curtains in a ghostlike fashion. There
was no need for covers, so she lay there allowing
the breeze to fan her toes. Half awake,
half asleep, she mused and dreamed of many
things.</p>
<p>The night was dark, the sky overcast.
Neither moon nor stars shone through. The
scene before her, save for a wavering light
here and there, was black. &ldquo;Like a beautiful
picture suddenly wiped out by the swing of a
broad, black brush,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Still there were the lights. One might
imagine them to be anything. In her fancy
she told herself that the red light, very high
above the water, was hung on the mast of the
old wood hauling schooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her hold is packed full of valuable
silks,&rdquo; she told herself. It was easy to dream
on such a night. One might imagine anything
and believe it.</p>
<p>She stared away toward old Fort Skammel.
A light flared over there. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re carrying
the silks from that hot little underground
room,&rdquo; she told herself, and at once became
quite excited about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should have gone over there this very day,&rdquo;
she mused.</p>
<p>But no, the light vanished. It showed no
more. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t load all that in the dark.
To-morrow,&rdquo; she said. There was an air of
finality in her tone.</p>
<p>She tried to see the ancient schooner, <i>Black
Gull</i>. Too dark for that. She could imagine
it all the same. She could see her swinging
there at anchor, a dark, brooding giant, whispering
of the past, telling of glorious old State
of Maine days, that were gone forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, love you, love you,&rdquo; the girl
whispered as if the dark old ship were a person,
a gallant knight of her dreams.</p>
<p>At that, leaning back on her pillow, one
brown hand beneath her head, she fell asleep.</p>
<p>Just how long she slept she may never know.
Enough that she suddenly found herself sitting
up wide awake and staring out at the bay
that was all aglow with a strange, lurid, unearthly
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end of the world,&rdquo; she told herself
and wondered at her own calmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Portland Harbor. It&rsquo;s on fire, burning
up!&rdquo; came a little more excitedly as she found
herself more truly awake.</p>
<p>It was only as she sprang to her feet and
stood there in the window with her dream
robes blowing about her that she realized the
full and terrible truth.</p>
<p>Then she covered her eyes with her hands
as she sank to the bed with a sharp cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Black Gull</i>, you are on fire. You are burning
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there she had at last the solemn truth.
At once her mind was in a whirl. How had it
happened? She recalled the curious visit she
and Betty had made there in the night and of
the remarkable pirate band that had come to
join them. Had these men returned? Had a
match carelessly dropped, a stove overheated,
brought the great catastrophe?</p>
<p>What could be done? Nothing. There was
no fireboat. No pipe line could reach her.
<i>Black Gull</i> was doomed.</p>
<p>In a state of suppressed excitement that held
her nerves at the bursting point, she sat there
watching a spectacle such as is the lot of few
to see.</p>
<p>At first the blaze, flaming fiercely, fanned by
the off shore breeze, went raging out to sea.
But at last, all at once, as if awed by this sublime
spectacle, the death of a great ship, the
wind dropped and the blaze, like flames of
some gigantic candle, rose up&mdash;up&mdash;up until it
seemed to the watching girl that they must
reach the sky and set the planets, the stars, the
very universe aflame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>As she sat there, lips apart, pupils dilated,
motionless, watching, the spectacle became a
thing of many dreams. Now the flames were
but the burning of a stupendous campfire, the
dark bulk that stood half concealed, half revealed,
docks, lighthouses, islands, were figures
of reposing and crouching giants.</p>
<p>Then the flames became a ladder of fire.
Down this ladder, a thousand angels, whose
wings could not be touched by fire, swarmed.</p>
<p>The ship burned with a clear, red flame now.
The water about her became a pool of red and
old rose. At the edge of this pool small bulks
moved, motor boats, row boats, launches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can they do?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Nothing.
Let them go to bed. They are like hunting
hounds, in at the death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>She wondered vaguely if the person responsible
for this catastrophe were circling there,
too. Strangely enough, she fancied she could
pick the man, a dark-faced foreigner with a
shock of black hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face-in-the-fire,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>For a moment she thought of dressing, of
launching her punt and going on a still hunt
for the man. In the end, she sat there watching
to the end the death of much that was dear
to her.</p>
<p>The end came with a suddenness that was
startling. The masts had fallen, one at a time.
Slowly, regularly, like seamen dropping from
a ladder into a dory, they fell to send sparks
shooting skyward. Then, with a thunder that
was deafening, there came the shock of a terrific
explosion.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds all the fire at the center
of the earth seemed to be shooting skyward.
Then darkness and silence, such as the
girl had never known, settled over all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Only the sea spoke. With a wild rushing
breath it whispered of wind and storms, of
treachery and death. Three times its whisper
came loudly from the sandy beach. Then
softly, it repeated its message until it died to
nothing, and a breeze springing up from nowhere
caught it up and carried it out to sea.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, her arms flung wide,
the girl stood there for a full moment. Rigid,
silent, she was swearing vengeance on the destroyers
of <i>Black Gull</i>.</p>
<p>Dropping to her place, again she scanned
the sea. One by one, like death candles, lights
were appearing. Here one, there one, they
formed at last the flaming outline of a ship&rsquo;s
deck. All had been burned or blown away but
the stout hull that for so many years had done
battle with the waves. For an hour these
burned brightly. Then, one by one they blinked
out. The tide was rising. The sea had come to
the rescue. It was extinguishing the fire. On
the morrow the black skeleton of a gallant ship
would show there above the restless waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she all but sobbed as she buried her
face in the pillow. &ldquo;<i>Black Gull</i> is gone forever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />THE SEARCHING PENCIL OF LIGHT</h2>
<p>Early next morning Ruth and Pearl sailed
the <i>Flyaway</i> to the scene of the night&rsquo;s conflagration.
No more mournful sight can be found
than the wreck of a great ship, lifting its shattered
form above the sea. They did not linger
long. One thing Ruth observed, and that to
her advantage in the future. The explosion
had blown a hole in the right side of the ship.
This left an open space above the water some
ten feet wide. Other than this, save at extreme
high tide, the ship&rsquo;s hull rose above the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes sort of a harbor,&rdquo; said Pearl. &ldquo;Believe
you could sail the <i>Flyaway</i> right inside.
Make a grand place to weather a squall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The three girls, Betty, Ruth and Pearl, fully
intended going to old Fort Skammel that day.
But life on the islands in Casco Bay is a busy
one. Fish must be caught, clams dug, crabs
and lobsters trapped and boiled. Summer visitors
must be served for it is their money that
fills the flour box, and the coal bin, too.</p>
<p>There was to be a great party up at the big
hotel. Crabmeat salad was on the menu. The
Brackets and Byrans were to supply the meal.
So, all day long Ruth and Pearl picked away
at boiled crabs, heaping up a little mountain of
white meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to go to the fort now,&rdquo; said
Ruth as she straightened up to ease her aching
back. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a sail instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So a sail it was. They dropped down around
the island and, skimming along over a faultless
sea, came at last just as the shadows were
deepening to Witches Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drop anchor and have our supper
here,&rdquo; suggested Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three gray witches may rise from the water
and ask to join us,&rdquo; said Ruth with a low
laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let them,&rdquo; said Pearl, sending the anchor
with a plunk into the sea. &ldquo;There are worse
creatures about than gray witches. Here&rsquo;s
hoping they don&rsquo;t come too close to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tide was setting in. The <i>Flyaway</i> which,
like some active child, seemed always aching
to be away, swung and turned, turned and
dragged at anchor until she lay within a few
feet of the rocky shore. Lying on the deck,
munching crabmeat sandwiches and whispering
of many things, the girls did not notice
this until, with a suddenness that was startling,
some dark object came flying through the
air to land lightly on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; exclaimed Pearl, springing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a black cat,&rdquo; laughed Ruth. &ldquo;Smelled
our crabmeat. There are some cunners in the
box by the mast. Give him one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had settled down once more to
quiet murmuring, when from the rocks on the
shore came a call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, there! Something tells me you have
one of my cats.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or he has us,&rdquo; said Pearl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It is you?&rdquo; It was the little Secret
Service man who spoke. &ldquo;How are you? Anything
new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know!&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;<i>Black Gull</i>
is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. But I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t see very well. She was
blown up. Wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be any explosives
in her hold, was there? Who put them
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth went on to remind him of her stolen
punt and of the explosives she had found in it.
She told him too of the secret meeting of the
mock pirates on the <i>Black Gull</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does look like the work of the man smugglers,&rdquo;
he admitted. &ldquo;Question is, were they
using the old ship as a storehouse for stolen
explosives, or did they wish to destroy the
meeting place of those who have been attempting
to bring them to justice?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s
silence, &ldquo;the <i>Black Gull</i> is gone, and that&rsquo;s one
more loss to charge against them. Something
tells me that their days in this, the Land of the
Free and the Home of the Brave, are numbered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Ruth fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; whispered Pearl, leaning close,
&ldquo;shall we tell him about Fort Skammel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not yet,&rdquo; the other girl whispered
back.</p>
<p>His lunch finished, the black cat was returned
to his master, then in the darkness the
<i>Flyaway</i> edged out to the channel and away
toward home.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the deeper channel where
larger boats might be encountered, they sailed
close to old Fort Skammel. There in the shadows
of those ancient walls they met with
further adventure.</p>
<p>As they came very close to the fort that at
this point towers straight above the sea, the
night suddenly went dark. It was as if some
ghost of other days, a prisoner perhaps who
had died in the fort&rsquo;s dungeon, had turned off
the light of the Universe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Ruth shuddered and suddenly felt herself
grow cold all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a very dark cloud before the moon,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;No danger. Know the way
in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she did, but there was danger all the
same. That she knew well enough in a moment,
for of a sudden there came the pop-pop
of a gasoline motor and a boat swinging round
the point of the island began following them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one lives on the island,&rdquo; she said to
Pearl in a low tone tense with emotion. &ldquo;They
must be following us. They burned <i>Black Gull</i>
last night. Now they are after us. Well, if the
wind holds they won&rsquo;t get us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her boat exactly before the wind.
Her deck tipped till it dipped water. Yet the
staunch-hearted girl did not alter the course
by so much as an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em, <i>Flyaway</i>. Show &rsquo;em!&rdquo; She spoke
in tender tones as if the schooner were a child.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>They were gliding silently up the bay when
a pencil of light like a hot finger reached forward
to touch them, then blinked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerful electric torch,&rdquo; the girl told herself.</p>
<p>A moment, two, three passed. The pop-popping
grew louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaining,&rdquo; she said with a sigh that was a
sob. &ldquo;Should have told all. Had the customs
officials, Civil Service, Captain O&rsquo;Connor and
all after them,&rdquo; she said to Pearl. &ldquo;But that
room in the old fort. I wanted to see it. Silks,
dresses, such things as she&rsquo;d never seen, that&rsquo;s
what Betty said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pencil of light felt for them again out
of the dark, found them, then swung away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearer,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;Much nearer. Get us.
And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned far forward, trying to see into
the night. Fort Georges was ahead there somewhere,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>The sudden reach of the white finger of light
showed her something&mdash;a dark bulk straight
ahead.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash she shot a line free, gripped
a yardarm, reefed the sail, reached out into the
dark, felt something, braced herself against it,
held the schooner away, but allowed her to
move forward until with a sigh she lost the
touch of that hard bulk and all but fell into
the sea.</p>
<p>The schooner swerved to the right, then
glided forward once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; Ruth whispered. &ldquo;We are inside the
sunken hull of <i>Black Gull</i>. For&mdash;for the moment,
even in death she has saved us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; she said ten seconds later. &ldquo;We
will leave the <i>Flyaway</i> here and take to our
dory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they crept away into the night with muffled
oars making no sound, they saw the pencil
of light searching the bay for them. It searched
in vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>A half hour later they were on their own
beach. At once Don in the <i>Foolemagin</i> was
away with three armed men to scour the bay.
They found the <i>Flyaway</i> where the girls had
left her, inside the scarred hull of <i>Black Gull</i>,
but the motor boat with its creeping pencil of
white light had vanished off the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; Ruth said to Pearl as she
bade her good night, &ldquo;shall be the last day.
Either we visit the mystery room of old Fort
Skammel or we turn the whole affair over to
the authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before retiring Ruth sat for a long time before
her window, looking out into the night,
thinking things through.</p>
<p>The night was too dark to see far. In a way,
she was thankful for that. <i>Black Gull</i> was
gone. She felt a tightening at the throat.
When she recalled how the broken and charred
skeleton of this once noble boat had saved her
from something very terrible, she wanted to
cry. Two unruly tears did splash down on her
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be brave,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;There
is much work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Work. They would go to old Fort Skammel
in the morning. She was sure of that. And
then?</p>
<p>The whole affair, or group of affairs, as she
looked back upon them, now appeared to be
coming together. The old wood ship with the
bolts of cloth in her hold, the dory&rsquo;s creaking
oars in the night, their visit to <i>Black Gull</i>, the
strange pirate band, the face-in-the-fire, the
curious little man at Witches Cove, the mysterious
room at the heart of the old fort, their
pursuers this very night, it all appeared to be
reaching out to join into a solid whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me at all if Betty&rsquo;s experience
off Green Island with the big guns
and the seaplane might prove to be a part of
the drama, though how I can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound from off the bay reminded her of
the great dark seaplane Pearl had seen off
Monhegan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Monhegan and the girl I saved from the
sea,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;How do they work
in? Well, perhaps they don&rsquo;t. As life is built
up, some stones must be thrown aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she said quite suddenly, &ldquo;life is a
joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the words did not seem to ring
true. She was tempted to wonder how she had
come to believe that at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the way that boy said it, I suppose,&rdquo;
she told herself. &ldquo;Some people have a way
about them. They are hard to resist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping to the chest of drawers in one corner
of her room, she took out the figured taffeta
dress. It was a very attractive dress&mdash;pink
roses over a background of pale gray.
She had never worn it. To wear it would be
to declare to her little world that she believed
life was a joke. At least that was the way she
felt about it. So, as yet, she did not feel ready
to put it on.</p>
<p>Spreading it out on the bed, she looked at it
for a long time. Then, carefully folding it up
again, she put it back in the drawer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>After that, with all the realization of what
to-morrow might bring forth, she did something
she had not done since she was a little
child. She dropped on her knees beside her
humble bed, and placed her palms together in
prayer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE OLD FORT</h2>
<p>Coming events do not always cast their
shadows before them; or, if they do, those
shadows are so filmy and ghostlike that only
one endowed with the keenest of vision is able
to see them. Never was there a fresher, calmer
sea than that which greeted the three girls,
Betty, Pearl and Ruth, when they pushed off
in Ruth&rsquo;s punt that morning bound for Fort
Skammel. A perfect morning, not a shadowy
suggestion of adventure. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>An hour after they left the sandy beach of
the island, Ruth&rsquo;s unnerved fingers dropped a
lighted electric torch on the floor at the heart
of the ancient fort. It fell with a dull thud,
and blinked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot,&rdquo; Ruth whispered. &ldquo;The air down
there is hot!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; Betty whispered back. She was
working feverishly, struggling to free a second
flashlight from the tangled mesh of her knitted
sweater pocket.</p>
<p>Sensing what she was about, Ruth whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get&mdash;get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; The younger girl&rsquo;s words came
in short gasps.</p>
<p>Little wonder that they were startled. Having
penetrated into the very heart of the old
fort, having made their way through a one-time
secret passage to a dungeon, they had
come at last to the door in the floor. And the
door stood wide open. Against their cheeks,
grown cold from constant contact with clammy
air, had blown a breath that seemed hot like
the blast of a furnace.</p>
<p>They had come to a sudden halt, and there
they stood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Even in the broad light of day there is something
gloomy, foreboding and mysterious
about old Fort Skammel. Children who have
ventured across the bay to the all but deserted
island, where this ancient abandoned fort
stands, will tell you of curious tales of adventures
met with there, how the red eyes of rats
as big as cats gleamed at them in the dark, how
they have discovered secret passageways that
led on and on until in fright they turned and
went racing back into the bright light of day,
and how at times ghostlike voices sounded
down the echoing aisles.</p>
<p>In a little cove where the sand was snow
white the three girls had drawn their punt
high on the beach. Pearl had volunteered to
stand guard outside. The other two had begun
wending their way over a path that winds between
tall grass and bushes to the fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Finding themselves at last before a great
open stone archway that led directly into the
chill damp of the fort, they had paused to listen
and to think. The next moment, with a little
quickening at her heart, Ruth had led the
way into the semi-darkness of a stone corridor,
and from there on and on into the deepening
darkness. Now, here they were. Ruth had
longed to look into that mysterious room. The
opening to it was now at her feet, yet she felt
more inclined to run away than to linger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get it?&rdquo; she whispered again, as
no light appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s caught in my pocket. No, now I have
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant a yellow light brought out
once more the damp and dripping walls of
stone with the mysterious opening in the floor
at their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hot.&rdquo; Ruth&rsquo;s tone was full of awe.
&ldquo;I felt it. I felt hot air on my cheek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting out two fingers, Ruth felt the fanning
of hot air. &ldquo;Warm,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not hot.
Just seemed that way. But how could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a stove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Tons of granite above.&rdquo; Her eyes
sought the low stone arch over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to see,&rdquo; said Ruth stoutly, dropping
on her knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>With a gasp Betty put out a hand to stop
her. She was too late. Ruth had caught the
ledge and swung down. Betty could but follow.
The next instant they were looking upon
a strange scene. This room, warmed by some
mysterious power, as Betty had said, was piled
high with bales and boxes of every description.</p>
<p>One of the boxes had slid from its place and
burst open, revealing a half dozen silk dresses
of bright and varied hues.</p>
<p>At once Ruth&rsquo;s heart was in her throat.
Here was treasure. Where was its keeper?</p>
<p>A rapid survey of the room revealed the surprising
fact that there was no keeper, or at
least, if there was one, he was away.</p>
<p>The thing that the two girls did after recovering
from their astonishment might, by some
cold and practical people, seem the height of
folly. Certainly, under the circumstances, it
could not be called wise. But who of us all behave
wisely at all times?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Placing the flashlight carefully in the niche
in the wall, Ruth picked up the top dress of
the half dozen in the broken cardboard box.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful thing of purple, so thin
and soft that it waved like a rippling sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Just my
size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she knew what she was about, her
khaki waist and knickers were off and the
beautiful dress was on.</p>
<p>Not a moment had passed before Betty, too,
was dressed in silk, a marvelous creation of
flaming red.</p>
<p>And then, faint and from far away, there
echoed down the long-abandoned corridors the
sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; Seizing the flashlight, with no
thought of how she was garbed, Ruth leaped
up and out, then on tiptoe went racing down
the aisle that led away from the chamber of
mysteries, and on and on into the dark.</p>
<p>Madly the feet of the two girls flew down a
winding corridor, wildly their hearts beat, as
they fled from resounding footsteps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Now the round circle of yellow light from
their electric torch guided them. And now, as
Ruth suddenly realized that the light would
reveal their whereabouts, the light blinked out,
and, dropping to a walk, then to a slow creep,
guided only by the sense of touch, they moved
along between the dripping walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could anything be worse?&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Ruth came back.</p>
<p>She was thinking, thinking hard. Tales had
been told of ancient wells dug there years ago
to enable the garrison to withstand a siege.
That the wells now stood uncovered down
there somewhere in the depths of the earth,
she knew all too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we blunder into one of those!&rdquo; Her heart
stopped beating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dresses!&rdquo; Betty whispered suddenly.
&ldquo;Our khakis! We left them. We must go back
for them. They will have us arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t. They won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ruth, still
pushing ahead in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to turn on the light,&rdquo; she told herself.
&ldquo;Must! It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pausing to listen, she caught the shuffling
scamper of rats, the snap of bats. But louder
still came the tramp&mdash;tramp of heavy feet.</p>
<p>In her fear and despair, she sprang forward,
to go crashing against a solid wall.</p>
<p>Knocked half senseless, she sank to her
knees. There for a moment she remained motionless.
For a moment only, then she was on
her feet and away. Her eyes had caught a faint
glimmer of light. Far down the narrow passage
to the left shone the steady light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light!&rdquo; she whispered solemnly. &ldquo;Light
and hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One moment of mad racing and they were
blinking in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The race was not over. Out of the passage,
down a set of ancient stone steps, into the
grass and bushes, skirts tight and high, they
flew until they came up short and panting at
the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>There in the calm morning were Pearl and
the punt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Ruth puffed. &ldquo;Thank God,
you&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next moment she stood knee deep in water,
launching the punt. Then with a little gasp of
hope, she swung the punt about and began
rowing as if for her very life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />SECRETS TOLD</h2>
<p>For a full ten minutes the three girls appeared
to act a perfect scene in a moving picture.
Ruth rowed furiously. Betty sat with
eyes fixed on the receding shoreline. Pearl
stared at Ruth and Betty with unbelieving
eyes.</p>
<p>At the end of that time Ruth dropped her
oars to mop her brow. They were now well
out in the bay. Fishing boats and motor launch
dotted the bay. It was day, bright and fair.
No one was pursuing them. To all appearances
they were as safe here as at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo; Pearl was still
staring at their silk dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; Ruth began, with mock gravity,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a marvelous place down there in
the old fort. You go in dressed in cotton blouse
and knickers and you come out all togged up in
silk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em try it!&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;d taken
the whole pile they wouldn&rsquo;t dare. They&rsquo;re
trespassers, smugglers, thieves, perhaps. It&rsquo;s
safe enough. But girls,&rdquo; her tone grew suddenly
sober, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time some one in authority
took a hand. This has been a perfectly glorious
adventure, thrilling, mysterious and all
that, but it&rsquo;s gone quite far enough. Who
shall we tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little man at Witches Cove,&rdquo; said Pearl.
&ldquo;He is a Secret Service man. Besides, he&rsquo;s
quite wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. Witches Cove it is,&rdquo; said
Ruth, gripping her oars once more. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
hug the right shore. That way, anyone that&rsquo;s
watching can&rsquo;t tell for sure where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this precaution some one knew
whither they were headed, and no good came
of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The little man of Witches Cove had an uncanny
way of anticipating the arrival of visitors
to his rugged shores. They found him
seated on a great boulder with his feet dangling
perilously near the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here we are
all dressed up for a party. Two sisters and
Cinderella. I suppose I am to fit out our little
sister with a silver slipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His round, good humored face grew suddenly
sober as Ruth told their reason for coming.
He interrupted her but once. Then he
cautioned her to lower her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have truly made a marvelous discovery,&rdquo;
he said when she had finished. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
looking for some such thing. It comes a little
sooner than I expected. Three of my men will
be on the afternoon boat from Boston. As soon
as they are here we will formulate plans for
action. In the meantime I shall have an eye on
the old fort. They cannot remove a schooner
load of silks from under my nose, I assure you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; his gaze swept the circle of
three eager faces, &ldquo;this, I take it, is going to
be a splendid day for fishing. And when you
fish,&rdquo; his smile broadened, &ldquo;you keep very still.
In other words, mum it is. You must not
breathe a word to another soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; they said in unison.</p>
<p>So the day was well begun. But it was not
ended, not by a good deal.</p>
<p>The three girls did not go fishing, at least
not at once. They did accept the little man&rsquo;s
counsel in regard to the earlier happenings of
the morning. Not one word regarding them
passed their lips.</p>
<p>They did wish to go fishing, later in the day,
but in the meantime there was work to be
done. Summer folks must have their clam
chowder. To Ruth and Pearl fell the lot of
digging the clams. All forenoon, under the
boiling sun, ankle deep in mud and sand, they
dug and clawed away with their clam forks
until three great baskets were heaped high
with blue-black clams. Then they hurried
home to dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>By mid-afternoon they were ready for a
well-deserved lark.</p>
<p>Betty joined them at the pier. Ruth had
drawn the <i>Flyaway</i> alongside, had put on
board their lines, bait and lunch, and was preparing
to cast off the line when her eyes fell
upon a woebegone and drooping little figure
on the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;Well, I never!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the little girl I saved from the surf up at Monhegan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d
gone back to Monhegan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s head shook slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother got afraid when we sailed away
down here in that boat you fixed up. She
thought Monhegan was too wild and dangerous.
But it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her spirit flared up like a
torch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just glorious. It&rsquo;s dreadfully dull
down here. We&mdash;&rdquo; she looked at the boy at
her side, and Ruth saw that it was her brother,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to do something terrible pretty
soon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;I say! We&rsquo;re
going fishing. Want to go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up at the boy. &ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;
He pushed her toward the <i>Flyaway</i>.</p>
<p>Ruth recognized this as a generous act. She
wanted to ask him to come, too, but it had
been agreed that this was to be a girls&rsquo; party.</p>
<p>It was Don who saved the day for her. He
was on the <i>Foolemagin</i>, busy mending a lobster
trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going round the island in a little while to
lift some traps,&rdquo; he said, looking at the boy.
&ldquo;Care to go along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad to.&rdquo; The boy turned and helped his
sister aboard the <i>Flyaway</i>. Ruth cast off the
line. The sail went up. She swung about.
Then they went skimming down the bay.</p>
<p>Pearl and the little city girl went forward to
lie upon the prow and watch the water gliding
by. Ruth and Betty remained at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; said Ruth, quite suddenly, &ldquo;is life
a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is life a joke?&rdquo; Betty gave her a quick look
as she suspected her of playing a trick upon
her. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said slowly when she realized
that her friend was in earnest, &ldquo;life is not a
joke. Life is beautiful, wonderful. How could
anything that is all this be a joke? Why?
What made you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boat glided smoothly over the water,
Ruth told her why; told her of the city boy&rsquo;s
laugh and of his remark about life. She told,
too, of the figured taffeta dress, the alligator
shoes and the gay hat.</p>
<p>When she had finished, little Betty, who was
so young, yet who had seen so much of life, of
its joys and sorrows, its struggles, pains and
triumphs, sat with half-closed eyes, thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what life is?&rdquo; she said at last.
&ldquo;Life is a struggle, a glorious, terrible battle.
You begin it when you begin life. You end it
when you breathe your last breath. To hope,
to dream, to struggle on,&rdquo; her slight figure
grew suddenly tense, &ldquo;to fall and rise again.
To see a star, a gleam of hope, to battle toward
it, to be beaten back, defeated, to turn again to
hope and dream and win, only to see a fairer
light, a lovelier vision farther on the way, then
to hope and dream again. That&mdash;&rdquo; she ended,
throwing her arms wide, &ldquo;that is life, a beautiful,
glorious thing! No! No! It can&rsquo;t be a
joke! It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ruth,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;what have
your new dress and shoes and hat to do with
life being a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the flicker of a smile played about
the big girl&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I thought if life were a
joke, then one might as well have what she
wants. I&rsquo;ve always wanted those things, so I&mdash;I
got them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spell happiness to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had a right to them. Everyone
has a right to happiness. Did you ever think of
that? Every man, woman and little child has
a right to happiness bought at a fair price. And
the price of a new dress, shoes and a hat is not
too much. There now!&rdquo; Betty ended, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
done a lot of preaching. Here&rsquo;s Witches Cove.
Give me a nice fat clam and a big hook. I feel
lucky to-day.&rdquo; With a laugh she began unwinding
her line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />KIDNAPPED</h2>
<p>The dull gray of evening hung over a calm
sea. From out the west came threats of sudden
storm that, sweeping in with the speed of
thought, might at any moment turn twilight
into darkest night.</p>
<p>The two boys, Don and the city boy, Lester
Hilton, had just completed the laborious task
of dragging a heavy dory up a rock-strewn
beach. Don had left some lobster traps here.
He had come ashore to pick them up.</p>
<p>Shading his eyes, Don gazed out to sea.
Some object out there caught his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a barrel,&rdquo; he said in a puzzled
drawl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too big. Can&rsquo;t be a sailboat, nor a
motorboat, nor a punt, unless it is adrift. No
one is staying out while such clouds are threatening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Climbing to a higher level, he paused to look
again, and at once there came over his face a
look of deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How could it
happen on a calm sea?&rdquo; Closing his eyes for a
moment to secure a clearer vision, he stood
there erect, motionless.</p>
<p>Then, with the suddenness of one who has
received a terrible revelation, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pearl and Ruth and your sister in the
<i>Flyaway</i>. Their mast is gone. They are powerless.
In five minutes it will be dark. Soon
the sea will be white with foam. They are out
there, your sister and mine, out there! Just
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lester did think. One instant his mind sped,
the next his hand was on the dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;but you must go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; The younger boy stood appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dory will ride almost any storm. You
must reach them, take them off the schooner
and bring them round the island to the lee
side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>All the time he talked Don was helping to
shove the dory off. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly reach
them before the storm and complete darkness
come. Both of us couldn&rsquo;t, not half way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will guide you. I&rsquo;ll find you a light so
strong you&rsquo;ll see all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger boy stared as if he thought his
companion mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the center of the island,&rdquo; Don spoke rapidly,
&ldquo;there is a powerful searchlight, a government
light for use only in time of war or a
great emergency. You have no idea of its
power, hundreds of thousands of candle power.
The keeper is away, but I know how to swing
it into place, to put on the power, to direct its
rays. Go! Quickly!&rdquo; He gave the dory a stout
shove, then went racing up the bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The impossible sometimes happens. That a
thirty-foot sailing vessel, as staunch a craft as
ever sailed the rock-ribbed sea, with a mast
twice the required thickness, should be drifting
helpless with mast and sail cast off and lost
from sight, should lie helpless in a calm sea
while a storm came tearing in from off the land
was, in time of peace, you might say, impossible.
Yet all this was just what was happening.
The <i>Flyaway</i> was hopelessly adrift. What
was more, Pearl Bracket, the golden-haired,
freckle-faced girl of Peak&rsquo;s Island, and Ruth
with her city friends, twelve-year-old Jessie
Hilton and Betty, were aboard. How could all
this happen in one calm afternoon?</p>
<p>It had all come about so suddenly that even
the four girls shuddering there on the mastless
schooner could scarcely believe it had happened
at all. They had sailed to Witches Cove.
Having dropped anchor within the shadows of
the overhanging rocks, they had tried their
hand at fishing.</p>
<p>It had been a curious afternoon, not exactly
cloudy, yet not exactly clear. A haze, a lazy
mist, drifted here and there. Never did
Witches Cove seem so spooky as now. Once
as Pearl looked up from her fishing she saw a
film of gray rise in the darkest corner of
the pool. As if fashioned by an invisible hand
it took the form of a witch with high hat and
hooked nose. She was even riding a broom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Pearl touched Ruth&rsquo;s arm and pointed. Ruth
saw and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gray Witch is riding to-day,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Something is sure to happen.&rdquo; In this she
was not wrong.</p>
<p>The fishing was unusually good. Soon the
deck of the <i>Flyaway</i> was alive with flapping
fish. In the excitement the Gray Witch and all
else was forgotten.</p>
<p>Then had come the supreme moment. Jessie
had hooked a twelve-pound rock cod. The
cod had showed fight. Before she could draw
him in he had fouled the line among the kelp.
So securely was he hooked that even then he
could not escape. So, with three girls tugging
at one line and the fish at the other, the red
kelp went swinging and swaying back and
forth at the bottom of the pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>It was just at the moment when the kelp
seemed about to lose its hold on the rock and
to come floating to the top with the magnificent
fish in its wake, that Pearl, chancing to
look away, dropped the line to spring back in
an attitude of fear.</p>
<p>She found herself looking into a pair of dark
eyes. Instinct told her to whom those eyes
belonged. &ldquo;The face-in-the-fire,&rdquo; her mind
registered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the bombers!&rdquo; she had whispered to
Ruth.</p>
<p>Like a flash all that the little man of Witches
Cove had told her passed through her mind.
He, the man of the rocky island, was a Secret
Service man in the employ of his government.
He had been stationed there to trace and if
possible capture two men who had been stealing
high explosives from the Army and Navy
store houses. These men were supposed to
belong to a band that was opposed to all organized
society. Several disastrous explosions
had been laid to their door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you can assist me in capturing them,&rdquo;
the Secret Service man had said, &ldquo;you will not
alone perform a great service to your country,
but may save many lives as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here were the very men! Pearl could
not doubt it. She shot one wild glance toward
the cabin on the rocks. No one was in sight.
Little hope for aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; she said aloud as she recognized
the second man. It was one of the men who
had stolen Ruth&rsquo;s punt and loaded it with dynamite.
A cold shudder ran up her spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of use in the world,&rdquo; the man
went on in a cold voice. &ldquo;We got you. We&rsquo;ll
teach you to meddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, to her great terror, he produced a
long whip such as was once used by cruel slave
owners. Cracking this about their ankles, he
ordered them down into the <i>Flyaway&rsquo;s</i> cabin.
Once they were down, he closed the door behind
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>For a whole hour, feeling the gentle roll of
the boat, knowing they were going somewhere
but having no notion what the destination
might be, they cowered in great fear. Finding
courage only by praying to the great Father
of all, they waited they knew not what.</p>
<p>At the end of that time they caught the
sound of the strokes of an axe. This was followed
by a sickening splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mast is gone!&rdquo; Pearl thought to herself.
&ldquo;Will they sink our boat and leave us to
drown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men had evidently planned for
them a more cruel fate. Having cut away the
mast and taken the oars, they set the motor
boat in which they had reached the schooner
going once more, and left the <i>Flyaway</i> and her
crew to drift helpless in the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be broken up on the rocks!&rdquo; Pearl&rsquo;s eyes
were dry, but in her heart was a solid weight
of sorrow.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Don was racing up a rocky trail while Lester
was tugging with all his might at the long
oars, driving the heavy dory farther and
farther out into the face of the oncoming
storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Then, like the dropping of a purple curtain
on a stage, came wind, rain and deep darkness.</p>
<p>The testing of Lester Hilton, the reckless
and daring city boy who believed that life was
a joke, was at hand. He now stood face to face
with triple peril&mdash;night, the sea and the storm.
He had no compass. There was no light to
guide him. There was now only to wait and
hope. This was hardest of all.</p>
<p>With unfaltering footsteps Don hastened on
into the dark until just before him a long low
bulk loomed. This was the power house. In
this house was the hoisting machine and the
powerful dynamos that lifted the great searchlight.
To break a window, to crawl through,
to touch a lever setting a dynamo purring, to
switch on a light, to throw a second lever, was
but the work of a moment.</p>
<p>Then again, he was outside. A little up the
hill, like a gigantic black ghost, some object
was rearing itself upward. This was a frame
on which the powerful searchlight rested.
When not in use it lay prone. It must now be
raised to an upright position. Powerful machinery
was doing this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>It was still leaning at a rakish angle when
the boy sprang up the ladder. By the time it
snapped into position he was in the small cabin
above. Here again he threw on an incandescent
lamp. One moment of suspense and a
great light flashed far out over the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>With skillful hand he began spraying the
sea with light as a gardener sprays a lawn.
Here, there, everywhere the light traveled.
Once, for ten seconds his eyes were fixed upon
a small gasoline boat ploughing its way
through the tossing waves. Then that spot
went dark. As yet his search was unrewarded.</p>
<p>But now, as the light swung closer in, it fell
upon a boy in a large dory. He was battling
the storm to keep his dory afloat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lester.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;s heart swelled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Swift as the flight of a gull, the light shot
outward until it fell upon a mastless boat wallowing
in the trough of a wave. There it came
to rest.</p>
<p>How the young city boy, little accustomed
to the sea, pulling for the spot marked by that
light, battled his way forward until at last,
drenched, hands blistered, well nigh senseless
with fatigue, he overhauled the crippled boat,
and how after that three girls and a boy fought
the storm and won will remain one of the
tales to be told round island cottage fires on
stormy nights.</p>
<p>One incident of that night will always remain
burned on Don&rsquo;s brain. As he held his
light steadily in its place, there struck his ears
a deafening crash that was not thunder, and
instantly the sky was illumined by a glare that
was not lightning. When, a half hour later, he
was free to search the sea for the floundering
motor boat which his light had first picked up,
it had disappeared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A FIRE ON THE BEACH</h2>
<p>As Don at last threw off the powerful searchlight
and descended the steel stairway that led
to the ground, two problems stood out in his
mind. He had broken all rules in using the
searchlight. There had been strict rules about
that. No civilian was to touch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;they may send
me to jail if they must. I&rsquo;d do it again for my
sister and for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other question that puzzled him was one
regarding that explosion at sea. Since he
knew nothing of the afternoon&rsquo;s happenings at
Witches Cove and their aftermath at sea, he
could make little of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>As for the four girls, they had, it seemed to
Ruth at least, lived a lifetime in a few hours.
In one short afternoon they had experienced
peace, hope, joy, near triumph, fear, disaster
and all but death. What more could there be
to life?</p>
<p>The little city girl had behaved wonderfully.
She had sat wide eyed, calm and silent through
it all.</p>
<p>The city boy puzzled Ruth most of all. Battling
the waves like a veteran seaman, he
reached them alone in the heavy dory. Then,
without a word, he put his shoulder to an oar
and began helping them to beat their way back
to land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he thinks life is a joke,&rdquo; Ruth told herself.
Then in a flash it came to her. This boy
once thought that life was a joke. He did not
really believe it; was not living as if life were
a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll forget all he thinks,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;and become a wonderful man. I am
glad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>When they had circled a rocky point and
come to the lea, they drove their boat on a
narrow beach. There they built a roaring fire
and sat down to dry their clothes. There Don
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you lose your mast? What was
that explosion?&rdquo; he demanded excitedly.</p>
<p>It was Ruth who told of the afternoon&rsquo;s
events. In the telling she was obliged to add
much about old Fort Skammel and the bombing
smugglers that he had not known before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you hear that explosion at sea?&rdquo; he
asked as she ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;and I have my ideas.
Looks to me as if we had seen the last of those
two men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think their motor boat blew up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they had explosives on board and
that the jarring of the waves set them off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;That might be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early next morning Don tuned up the <i>Foolemagin</i>
and went in search of the <i>Flyaway</i>. He
found her piled up on the beautiful broad beach
on Long Island. Save for a bump here and
there and the loss of her mast, she was quite
unharmed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>In a half hour&rsquo;s time he had her pulled off
and in tow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her in shipshape by noon,&rdquo; he told
Pearl over a belated breakfast. &ldquo;Uncle Joe has
a mast he took from an old boat. I&rsquo;ll put it in
and you can give her a tryout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during this tryout of the <i>Flyaway</i>
that the three girls bumped square into the last
great adventure of the season.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />THE CHASE</h2>
<p>They had just circled the last pleasure yacht
anchored before the island and were squared
away for a trip down the bay, when their attention
was attracted by a small motor boat
apparently stranded in mid-channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ferry will run them down if they don&rsquo;t
watch out,&rdquo; said Ruth, reaching for their
ancient brass field glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;well, now what?&rdquo; She dropped the
glass to stare at the boat with the naked eye.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your little friend the Secret Service man
from Witches Cove,&rdquo; she told Pearl. &ldquo;There
are three men with him and they seem no end
excited. One is trying frantically to get the
engine going. The other three are waving
wildly at us. Head her in that way. Give her
all the sail.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Pearl swung about. In an incredibly short
time they were within hailing distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boat can sail some, can&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; the
little man shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can,&rdquo; said Ruth through cupped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come alongside and take us on board.
They&rsquo;re getting away.&rdquo; The Secret Service
man swung his arm down the bay, where
through the light fog a second motor boat was
just passing behind the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s getting away?&rdquo; Ruth asked in some
astonishment as they came close up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bombers&mdash;the smugglers&mdash;the&mdash;the
wild rascals, whoever they may be, you know
as well as I.&rdquo; The man was in a great state of
perspiration. &ldquo;They just left old Fort Skammel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls stared as if they had seen a
ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; said Ruth as soon as she
found her voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dead, blown into a
thousand pieces by their own dynamite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; puffed the little man as he
scrambled aboard the <i>Flyaway</i>, followed by his
three companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her drift,&rdquo; he said as he saw Ruth eyeing
the stalled motor boat. &ldquo;Someone will
pick her up. There&rsquo;s important matters afoot.
What&rsquo;s one motor boat more or less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! Blown to pieces!&rdquo; he exclaimed as
soon as he had taken three deep breaths. &ldquo;Show
us you are sailors, and we&rsquo;ll prove to you that
they are neither dead nor blown to pieces. I
saw that wild looking fellow with the tangled
black hair and shining eyes, saw him plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of the face-in-the-fire,&rdquo; Ruth said
to Pearl, as she set the <i>Flyaway</i> to skimming
up the bay. &ldquo;The very one. Must be. What
do you know about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not one of the three knew what about it, so
they were silent until they too had rounded the
island and saw the fleeing boat, a low, dark
affair of moderate speed, popping along dead
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, will we overhaul them?&rdquo; the little
man asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will if the wind holds. May drop any time,&rdquo;
said Ruth. &ldquo;Little fog. May burn off. May
thicken. Can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo; With a boy&rsquo;s cap jammed
tight over her head, she stood there swaying
with the boat and giving her every inch
of sail she&rsquo;d carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be a race,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;a race
between the <i>Flyaway</i> and that motor boat.&rdquo;
There was something altogether unusual about
the whole affair. If these were the men, if
indeed they had escaped the storm and the explosion,
as indeed they appeared to have done,
then the <i>Flyaway</i>, which they had attempted
to destroy along with the three of them, was
hunting down the very ones who had meant to
destroy her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old <i>Flyaway</i>!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Do
your best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch them,&rdquo; she told herself a short
time later. &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; She dared not think
what might follow. These were desperate
men. If caught, they would serve long terms
in prison. They would not surrender without
a battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>It was strange the thoughts that passed
through her mind as they sped along. Now
she was thinking of that secret room in old
Fort Skammel. How was it heated? Were
the silks still there? If the men were captured,
what then? The silks would be confiscated by
the customs office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some sort of law that gives the
finder a share,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;We found
them right enough.&rdquo; She thrilled at the
thought of owning a room half filled with silk
dresses and bolts of silk cloth.</p>
<p>A moment later she was talking with the
little Secret Service man, joining him in an
effort to unravel the tangled web of mysteries
that had been woven about them.</p>
<p>She spoke first of the ancient wood carrying
schooner, of its dark foreign skipper and the
bales of cloth in the hold. The little man
seemed astonished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think you are entirely
wrong. Did you ever happen to look at that
skipper&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re hard as pine knots and the muscles
of his arms are like wooden beams. You don&rsquo;t
get a man like that for smuggling or stealing.
They love physical labor too much and the
contentment that comes with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed with her when she said that the
smugglers had a hand in the destruction of
<i>Black Gull</i>. That the cache in the old fort
was theirs, neither of them doubted.</p>
<p>When Ruth spoke of the dark seaplane Pearl
had seen off Monhegan on that stormy night,
he seemed greatly surprised and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we doing the best we can?&rdquo; he asked
suddenly, wrinkling his brow and looking up
at the sail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our level best,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;And if the
wind holds it is good enough. See, we have
gained half the distance already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>It was true. They had now come so close
to the fleeing craft that they were able to make
out moving figures on her.</p>
<p>Lifting the glass, Ruth studied the sea and
the power boat for a moment. Then, quite suddenly
she dropped the glass. She had looked
straight into that dark visage, the face-in-the-fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can one explain it?&rdquo; she said, as a
shudder ran through her stout frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain what?&rdquo; the little man asked.</p>
<p>Ruth told him of their harrowing experience
of the previous day and of the tremendous explosion
at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no explanation at present,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;There may never be any. We who
spend our lives delving into hidden mysteries
know that half of them are never solved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>In spite of the realization that they were
off on a perilous mission, Ruth felt a comforting
warmth take possession of her. Only yesterday,
with every hope apparently gone, she
had been drifting on a sailless, mastless boat
out to sea in the face of a storm. Now, with
that same boat, she was treading on the heels
of those who had willed her death. The end
of all the summer&rsquo;s excitement and mystery
was near.</p>
<p>But what was this? A thin film of smoke
rose from the power boat ahead. Ten seconds
had not passed before this had become a veritable
pillar of black towering toward the sky.
&ldquo;Their boat is on fire!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke screen,&rdquo; said the little man, still
calm. &ldquo;There! There! See? They are taking
to their dory! We&rsquo;ll get them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is that a little way over there to
the right, close to that little rocky island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes followed the direction she had indicated.
Then as one, they exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A seaplane! A seaplane! The dark, trans-Atlantic
plane! We have lost them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the men should escape now seemed inevitable.
The seaplane was moving rapidly
across the water. Soon she would be upon
the dory from the smoking schooner. A hasty
scramble aboard her, and they would rise to
speed away at such a pace as no sailboat ever
knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Ruth was ready to sit down and cry. She
had risked so much. She had experienced such
terrible things. She had hoped and hoped
again. Truly she had come to know what life
was. And now&mdash;</p>
<p>But again a surprise leaped at them from
the air. The thunder of an airplane motor, not
that of the dark seaplane, but another, struck
their ears. As it doubled and redoubled in
volume Ruth thought of the young air scout
who had assisted her in saving Betty&rsquo;s life off
Green Island, and a great surge of hope welled
up within her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />ON AIR AND SEA</h2>
<p>The scene that followed will remain in the
memories of the three girls as long as life shall
last. The sea, a thin fog, a great dark plane
rising slowly like a black swan from the water,
a small American pursuit plane appearing on
the distant horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it our young aviator?&rdquo; Ruth asked herself,
gripping at her breast to still her heart&rsquo;s
wild beating. &ldquo;Will he be in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higher and higher rose the giant plane.
Nearer and nearer came its little pursuer.</p>
<p>When she had risen to a height of a thousand
feet, the dark marauder began thundering
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>But of a sudden, a white gleam appeared
above her. The little silver plane was possessed
of great speed. The black giant, laden
with hundreds of gallons of gasoline for a
long journey, was slow in picking up. The
tiny pursuer was upon her. The fight was
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a catbird attacking a crow,&rdquo; Ruth
told herself. &ldquo;What will the end be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a daring that set the girl&rsquo;s blood racing,
the young aviator swooped down upon his
broad winged opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll crash into them,&rdquo; she thought in
sudden terror, &ldquo;He&mdash;he has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; said Betty who, all unconscious
of her actions, was dancing wildly about the
deck. &ldquo;There! There he is! He&rsquo;s come out
from behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the little plane rose. Again, he came
down, this time to the right and all but upon
a broad wing of the Devil Bird.</p>
<p>Then came a short, sharp, insistent sound
that was not made by motors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re shooting,&rdquo; said Ruth as a
fresh terror seized her. &ldquo;We must get closer.
They may bring him down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Gripping a rope, she sent her sail upward,
then prepared to glide ahead at full speed.</p>
<p>But now, matters took a fresh turn. So
close did the young aviator dive in that the
great black plane was set wobbling. It was
with the utmost difficulty that she righted herself.</p>
<p>Hardly had this been accomplished when the
little plane, with all the ferocity of a bird
robbed of her young, was upon her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; screamed Betty, now fairly
beside herself. &ldquo;There! There he goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the little plane did not drop. It wobbled
and twisted, turned half a flip-flop, righted itself
and was at the dark antagonist once more.</p>
<p>Again the pop-pop-pop-pop of shots.</p>
<p>This time, however, it broke short off as the
black plane, after an instant of seeming to
hang motionless in air, suddenly went into a
tail spin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; Betty closed her eyes.</p>
<p>When she opened them the black plane was
gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to the bottom,&rdquo; said Ruth solemnly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get over there at once. They may rise.
It&mdash;it&rsquo;s terrible to think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellows,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;They
will never come up. The plane, with her heavy
motors and her loaded tanks, took them
straight to the bottom. They deserved little
enough. They were the enemies of law and
order and all government. Since men must
live as neighbors, laws of conduct cannot be
avoided. They were blind to all this. They
saw wrongs in every land; men rich and living
extravagantly who deserved to live on hard
bread and wear rags, other men living in poverty,
and they said, &lsquo;We must destroy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was ever gained by destruction.
Wrongs must be righted by laws, and by instilling
into the hearts of all men a feeling of
brotherly kindness. Those who will destroy
will in the end bring destruction upon themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>The little pursuit plane had come to rest on
the sea. For a half hour both plane and sail
boat cruised the waters there, but no sign of
the missing plane rose from the depths.</p>
<p>When the little plane at last drew in close
Ruth saw, with a sudden tremor at her heart,
that the young aviator of that other day by
Green Island was in the forward cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to spoil your game,&rdquo; he said, standing
up. &ldquo;But he was about to get away. And
that wouldn&rsquo;t do. Done enough damage already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;We
owe you a vote of thanks. You were lucky to
escape. There was shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did all the shooting,&rdquo; said the young
man. &ldquo;I was only trying to force them down
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;you did that
with a vengeance. And now,&rdquo; he said briskly,
&ldquo;we better get back to old Fort Skammel.
These young ladies tell me that there&rsquo;s a secret
cache of silks there. I have no doubt there
are papers of great importance there too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like to ride back with me?&rdquo; said the young
aviator, looking at Ruth. &ldquo;I&mdash;I promised you
a trip, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ruth, climbing into the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get over to the fort and keep guard
there until you arrive,&rdquo; said the aviator, waving
them goodbye as Ruth&rsquo;s last strap was
safely buckled into place.</p>
<p>It was a strange world that Ruth looked
down upon as she sped along&mdash;her own little
world seen from above. Islands, homes, ships,
all floated like miniature affairs of paper beneath
her. Then, much too soon, they were
skimming the bay for a landing.</p>
<p>All was serene and dreamy about old Fort
Skammel as the two, Ruth and her pilot, came
ashore there. Dragon flies darted here and
there. Spider webs drifted by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The calm of a Sabbath afternoon,&rdquo; said the
young pilot. &ldquo;How good it is to be alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; Ruth replied, blinking at the sun
and struggling to reassemble her scattered
thoughts, &ldquo;could not be sweeter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>An hour later, with the Secret Service man
in the lead and an armed guard stationed along
the corridors, the little company entered the
room of many mysteries.</p>
<p>They were all there, Ruth, Pearl, Betty and
even the little city girl who had come over in
a row boat. And such a time as they had
feasting their eyes on the softness and beauty
of the silks laid out before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />THE STORY TOLD</h2>
<p>A few moments later the men from the
revenue cutter were passing boxes and bales of
silk up from the strangely snug underground
room, and had begun carrying them down dim
corridors to the ancient granite dock that had
once served the fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingenious chaps, those fellows were,&rdquo; the
little Secret Service man said, touching an electric
heater. &ldquo;Ingenious and resourceful.
Heated the place with electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did they get the current?&rdquo; Ruth
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an electric power cable passing
across the island. They wired this place, then
waited for a time when the current was off to
tap the line, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great deal more that remains to
be explained,&rdquo; said the little man. &ldquo;I fancy I
shall find it all recorded here.&rdquo; He patted a
great heap of books and papers which he had
collected from one corner of the room. &ldquo;If
you young folks wish to come out to Witches
Cove rather late in the afternoon, I am quite
sure I shall have a lot to tell. Like to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we!&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try us,&rdquo; said Betty, standing on tiptoes in
her excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled, then. Come in the <i>Flyaway</i>
at dusk. I&rsquo;m sure the three gray witches will
be there to greet you. So will I, and my two
black cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; he said a little later as he stood
by the great heap of silks that lay on the
dock ready to be transported to the customs
house, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t permit each one of you to
select a wardrobe from among these beautiful
creations, but the law wouldn&rsquo;t permit that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>As their eyes rested on the broken bundles
from which rich garments of rare beauty shone
through, they felt that he spoke the truth.</p>
<p>That evening, just as the shadows had turned
the dark green waters of Witches Cove to
pitchy black, the three girls, Ruth, Pearl and
Betty, rode into that little natural harbor of
many mysteries. Having dropped anchor,
they rowed Ruth&rsquo;s punt silently to the rocky
shore, then mounted the rugged natural stairway
to the cabin that crowned the crest.</p>
<p>A curious light, flickering and dancing, now
waving, now glowing bright, played hide and
seek through the cabin&rsquo;s two small windows.
A driftwood fire was burning in the large room
of the place.</p>
<p>Before this fire, on the skin of some great
bear whose grinning white teeth seemed ready
to devour them, sat the little man. On either
side of the hearth the two black cats sat blinking.
Before him was a heap of papers and a
thick black book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, moving over to give
them room. Lifting a simmering pot from the
hearth, he poured them delicious hot chocolate
in cups as blue-green as the waters of Witches
Cove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We drink to the health of all loyal sons and
daughters of Maine,&rdquo; he said, lifting a cup to
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all written here,&rdquo; he said after a moment
of solemn meditation. &ldquo;Written down in this
book.&rdquo; He patted the fat black book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;that
men cannot resist recording deeds of daring.
Whether they be done for lawful or unlawful
purposes, makes no difference. Even the Buccaneers
had their historians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of this,&rdquo; again he touched the
book, &ldquo;was none other than that dark fellow,
whom you called the &lsquo;face-in-the-fire&rsquo; man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkable story,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Lindbergh crossed the ocean once alone, and
the whole world went mad. This man made
seven round trips from Europe to America and
there was not one shout. Because,&rdquo; he paused&mdash;&ldquo;because
almost no one knew. Seven men
knew. They dared not tell. He brought them
to America one at a time in the gray seaplane
in which he to-day met so tragic a death. Our
nation refused them entrance. He brought
them. Very soon now they will be found and
sent back. But because these men could not
pay him, he engaged in silk smuggling. He
used the old fort as a hiding place because no
one would expect to find him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Ruth leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;Why did he do all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He crossed the ocean seven times bringing
each time a man,&rdquo; the speaker went on impressively.
&ldquo;Each time he recrossed the lonely
old ocean alone. Think of it! Seven times!
An unbroken record!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loyalty,&rdquo; he stared thoughtfully at the fire,
&ldquo;loyalty is a wonderful thing. But loyalty to
a wrong cause can bring only disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This man and his seven friends believed
that the private ownership of property was
wrong, that your home, your boat, your horse,
your dog, yes and perhaps your very father
and mother, should belong to the State. That
all men should own everything, and no individual
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; said Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so,&rdquo; the little man said. &ldquo;So do
I. So do most Americans. And yet that was
the principle for which they stood. For this
principle they would smuggle, bomb, cast helpless
girls adrift in a dismantled boat, destroy
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;is a terrible way to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think so. We believe that you have
done your country a great service. You will
not go unrewarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Betty,
&ldquo;is why they remained in the old fort and kept
their silks there after they knew that Ruth and
I had been in that room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They thought you were at the bottom of
the sea where they meant you to be,&rdquo; the little
man smiled. &ldquo;You would have been, too, had
it not been for that chap you call Don and
the fearless city boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we would,&rdquo; Ruth said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said the little man, &ldquo;is the end
of the story. You have all been fortunate.
You have helped solve mysteries and have
known adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lives from this day may flow as
smooth as a river, but the memory of this summer,
with its joys and hopes, its perils, despairs,
its defeats and victories can never be taken
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; he said, as he walked
with them to their waiting boat, &ldquo;Witches
Cove will be dark. My black cats and I are
leaving to-morrow. Good night, good-bye,
and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Ruth sat looking out once more
from her room upon the moonlit bay. Her
summer of adventure was over. Betty was returning
to Chicago. The cottages were closing.
Soon there would be left only the fisher
folks and the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;is quite wonderful,
and not a joke at all.&rdquo; She doubted if anyone
really, truly in the depths of their hearts, ever
thought it was.</p>
<p>So, sitting there in her chair, dreaming in
the moonlight, she allowed her head to fall
forward and was soon fast asleep.</p>
